Between 2018 and 2022, we sampled sediment entrained in icebergs in three fjord systems: Nuup Kangerlua (southwest, near Nuuk), Ikerasak (central-west, near Disko Island), and Kangertittivaq (central-east, also known as Scoresbysund) (Figure). In each fjord, we were able to visually identify toppled icebergs that had exposed debris-rich ice layers to the surface. These layers were very dark in color, offering a uniform, clean contact with the blue or white ice around them. The ice itself had regular air bubbles, spaced centimeters to decimeters apart, and often elongated (e.g., sheared). Sediment was entrained within the ice, either as individual particles, ranging from fine sands (0.1 mm) through cobbles (200 mm), or as aggregate clusters of fine silts (< 0.05 mm). 

We took samples by hand, used a freeze-dryer to sublimate away the ice, and calculated rafted sediment concentrations (RSC) as the ratio of sediment mass to total mass in each sample. Across all three fjord systems, we see a long-tailed distribution in RSC, ranging from 0.001% to 45% by mass (Figure). The mean RSC values were X% (Nuup Kangerlua), Y% (Ikerasak), and Z% (Kangertittivaq). 

These results show that the basal ice layer beneath an outlet glacier is not uniform, as previously assumed. 

Debris-rich basal ice layers record sediment entrainment processes.
