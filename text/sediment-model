Observations from icebergs allow us to constrain the character and concentration of debris-rich basal ice layers. To quantify sediment fluxes, however, we also need an estimate of the true thickness of entrained sediment layers at the glacier terminus. Here, we use a numerical model of erosion, entrainment, and transport to predict the sediment flux at the terminus of each glacier in our sampled fjord systems.
