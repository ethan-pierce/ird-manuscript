	abstract = {Glacier mass loss is recognized as a major contributor to current sea level rise. However, large uncertainties remain in projections of glacier mass loss on global and regional scales. We present an ensemble of 288 glacier mass and area change projections for the 21st century based on 11 glacier models using up to 10 general circulation models and four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) as boundary conditions. We partition the total uncertainty into the individual contributions caused by glacier models, general circulation models, RCPs, and natural variability. We find that emission scenario uncertainty is growing throughout the 21st century and is the largest source of uncertainty by 2100. The relative importance of glacier model uncertainty decreases over time, but it is the greatest source of uncertainty until the middle of this century. The projection uncertainty associated with natural variability is small on the global scale but can be large on regional scales. The projected global mass loss by 2100 relative to 2015 (79 ± 56 mm sea level equivalent for RCP2.6, 159 ± 86 mm sea level equivalent for RCP8.5) is lower than, but well within, the uncertainty range of previous projections.},

	abstract = {Glacier slip is usually described using steady-state sliding laws that relate drag, slip velocity and effective pressure, but where subglacial conditions vary rapidly transient effects may influence slip dynamics. Here we use results from a set of laboratory experiments to examine the transient response of glacier slip over a hard bed to velocity perturbations. The drag and cavity evolution from lab experiments are used to parameterize a rate-and-state drag model that is applied to observations of surface velocity and ice-bed separation from the Greenland ice sheet. The drag model successfully predicts observed lags between changes in ice-bed separation and sliding speed. These lags result from the time (or displacement) required for cavities to evolve from one steady-state condition to another. In comparing drag estimates resulting from applying rate-and-state and steady-state slip laws to transient data, we find the peaks in drag are out of phase. This suggests that in locations where subglacial conditions vary on timescales shorter than those needed for cavity adjustment transient slip processes control basal drag.},

To test this hypothesis, a device that simulates subglacial conditions was used to push ice downward through idealized and natural porous media in contact with a flat bed. Ice regelated toward the bed at speeds proportional to the gradient in ice pressure across the thickness of particles. Ice temperatures responded predictably to changes in driving stress and demonstrated that the ice-particle mixtures were at or very near the pressure-melting temperature. A theory of pore ice motion by regelation predicted the measured speed usually to within a factor of two, although at low driving stresses the speed was less than the predicted value by as much as a factor of five. The low speeds were probably caused by imperfect temperature control that resulted either in heat loss from the ice-particle mixtures or in slightly subfreezing pore ice temperatures that were not detected by thermistors. Ice should intrude the pores of underlying sediment to a steady depth at which the downward regelation speed equals the rate of basal melting. Departures from the steady state should cause release of debris from ice or further entrainment. An approximate calculation of the steady intrusion depth yields values comparable to typical thicknesses of debris in basal ice, a few centimeters to more than a meter. Intrusion of sediment by regelation is consistent with the isotopic composition of debris-bearing ice, if melting exceeds refreezing.},

Böðvarsson’s 1955 plug-flow solution for an Icelandic glacier problem is shown to be an exact solution to the steady form of the simultaneous stress-balance and mass-continuity equations widely used in numerical models of marine ice sheets. The solution, which has parabolic ice thickness and constant vertically integrated longitudinal stress, solves the steady shallow-shelf approximation with linear sliding on a flat bed. It has an elevation-dependent surface mass-balance rate and, in the interpretation given here, a contrived location-dependent ice hardness distribution. By connecting Böðvarsson’s solution to the Van der Veen (1983) solution for floating ice, we construct an exact solution to the ‘rapid-sliding’ marine ice-sheet problem, continuously across the grounding line. We exploit this exact solution to examine the accuracy of two numerical methods, one grid-free and the other based on a fixed, equally spaced grid.},

	abstract = {Arctic coastal infrastructure and cultural and archeological sites are increasingly vulnerable to erosion and flooding due to amplified warming of the Arctic, sea level rise, lengthening of open water periods, and a predicted increase in frequency of major storms. Mitigating these hazards necessitates decision-making tools at an appropriate scale. The objectives of this paper are to provide such a tool by assessing potential erosion and flood hazards at Herschel Island, a UNESCO World Heritage candidate site. This study focused on Simpson Point and the adjacent coastal sections because of their archeological, historical, and cultural significance. Shoreline movement was analyzed using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) after digitizing shorelines from 1952, 1970, 2000, and 2011. For purposes of this analysis, the coast was divided in seven coastal reaches (CRs) reflecting different morphologies and/or exposures. Using linear regression rates obtained from these data, projections of shoreline position were made for 20 and 50 years into the future. Flood hazard was assessed using a least cost path analysis based on a high-resolution light detection and ranging (LiDAR) dataset and current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change sea level estimates. Widespread erosion characterizes the study area. The rate of shoreline movement in different periods of the study ranges from −5.5 to 2.7 m·a−1 (mean −0.6 m·a−1). Mean coastal retreat decreased from −0.6 m·a−1 to −0.5 m·a−1, for 1952–1970 and 1970–2000, respectively, and increased to −1.3 m·a−1 in the period 2000–2011. Ice-rich coastal sections most exposed to wave attack exhibited the highest rates of coastal retreat. The geohazard map combines shoreline projections and flood hazard analyses to show that most of the spit area has extreme or very high flood hazard potential, and some buildings are vulnerable to coastal erosion. This study demonstrates that transgressive forcing may provide ample sediment for the expansion of depositional landforms, while growing more susceptible to overwash and flooding.},

Models have progressed from strict adherence to the principles of groundwater flow, to the incorporation of flow ‘elements’ specific to the subglacial environment, to sophisticated two-dimensional representations of interacting distributed and channelized drainage. Although presently in a state of rapid development, subglacial drainage models, when coupled to models of ice flow, are now able to reproduce many of the canonical phenomena that characterize this coupled system.

Mass balance calculations and regional glacio-climatic conditions suggest that the sediment flux to the seafloor in Kangerdlugssuaq and Nansen fjords should be dominated by iceberg rafting and not by the rain-out of suspended particulates in meltwater, as the glacier calving flux is estimated at 15 and , compared to meltwater volumes of 4.4 and , respectively. Gravity cores in the three fjords indicate that the uppermost 1-2.5 m of sediment consists of diamictons or fine-grained laminated muds. AMS radiocarbon dates on calcareous foramininfera or shells (16 total) indicate sedimentation rates of 110 to 340 cm/ka within the fjords over the last 1 ka, and 10-20 cm/ka during the Holecene on the inner and middle shelf. Annual sediment discharge is around  tonnes/yr within the Kangerdlugssuaq Fjord and Trough system, which translates into an average basin-wide rate of denudation of 0.01 mm/yr (0.01 m/ka). Air gun and deep-towed (Huntec) seismic profiling was carried out in Kangerdlugssuaq and Nansen fjords, East Greenland, and showed that sediment fills averaged 500 and 350 m respectively; they consist primarily of acoustically stratified sediments. If the sediment fills are entirely Holocene in age then the required average sediment accumulation rates of 35-50 m/ka are an order of magnitude larger than the controlled rates of the last 1-2 ka. This raises the possibility that fjord sediments may be by-passed and not always recycled during glacial advances; this will affect sedimentation rates on adjacent shelves and deep-sea areas during successive glaciations.},

	abstract = {We aim to improve the understanding of sediment fluxes originating from ice sheet outlet glaciers in order to explain the evolution of sedimentary fjord fills. A numerical glacial erosion and sediment flux process model has been developed to quantify sediment generation and subglacial transport. Dynamic ice sheet cover is generated from topography and climate parameters, affecting the glacial net mass balance. Pressure, temperature and velocity characteristics of the ice sheet force erosion at the glacier bed. Bed erodability depends on bedrock hardness and potential shielding by sediment. After erosion, sediment is either stored at the bed, or transported either by meltwater or englacially (within basal ice). Model experiments show ice retreat is driven by valley topography; rapid retreat occurs in the flatter valley stretches and slower retreat in the steeper parts of a glacial valley. Distinct depocenters of exposed sediment develop during retreat. Predicted erosion rates in the glaciated valley range from 37 to 56mm/yr for different climate scenarios, which is well within the range of reported field reconstructions. Erosion is significantly accelerated beneath warm-based ice and the effect of an enlarged warm-based footprint during warming compensates for decreasing ice mass. Topographic shielding of bedrock by previously eroded material in large areas constrains erosion by a factor 4. Simulated glacier retreat and melt water flux initially occur at a high rate and subsequently decelerate, while sediment delivery exhibits a distinct lagging of several thousands of years behind the meltwater flux. Upon the transition from glaciation to deglaciation, the subglacial system is in a sediment-starved state. Late-deglacial erosion and sub- and englacial sediment storage cause a lagging sediment delivery to downstream periglacial, fluvial and lacustrine domains.},

The path of the icebergs, clearly marked by the presence of ice-rafted detrital carbonate, can be traced for more than 3,000 km—a remarkable distance, attesting to extreme cooling of surface waters and enormous amounts of drifting ice. The cause of these extreme events is puzzling. They may reflect repeated rapid advances of the Laurentide ice sheet, perhaps associated with reductions in air temperatures, yet temperature records from Greenland ice cores appear to exhibit only a weak corresponding signal. Moreover, the 5–10,000-yr intervals between the events are inconsistent with Milankovitch orbital periodicities, raising the question of what the ultimate cause of the postulated cooling may have been.},

	abstract = {Basal hydrology is acknowledged as a fundamental control on glacier dynamics, especially in cases where surface meltwater reaches the bed. For many glaciers at midlatitudes, basal drainage is influenced by subaerial, englacial, and subsurface water flow. One of the major shortcomings of existing basal hydrology models is the treatment of the glacier bed as an isolated system. We present theoretical and computational models that couple glacier surface runoff, englacial water storage and transport, subglacial drainage, and subsurface groundwater flow. Each of the four model components is represented as a two-dimensional, vertically integrated layer that communicates with its neighbors through water exchange. Governing equations are derived from the law of mass conservation and are expressed as a balance between the internal distribution of water and external sources. The numerical exposition of this theory is a time-dependent finite difference model that can be used to simulate glacier drainage. In this paper we outline the theory and conduct simple tests using an idealized glacier geometry. In the companion paper, the model is tailored to Trapridge Glacier, Yukon Territory, Canada, where results are compared with measurements of subglacial water pressure.},

Because such models make no explicit reference to the geological products of glaciation, the full potential of a combined approach has not been realized. We present the results of a process-based model of sediment production, entrainment, transport and deposition that represents a first step toward uniting these two lines of investigation. In this model basal-ice processes are dependent on ice sheet geometry, hydrology and dynamics. A three-dimensional thermomechanical ice sheet model yields the ice geometry, flow and thermal conditions that are used by a model of subglacial hydrology; together these drive the basal process model. Comparisons of simulation results with mapped debris distributions of the Hudson Bay Paleozoic carbonates and of the distinctive Dubawnt Group are used to test the validity of the transport model. Dispersion of debris radially out of Hudson Bay is greatly overestimated by the model, and dispersion toward the bay equally underestimated. This is because the modelled ice sheet has a single dome over Hudson Bay at glacial maxima, including Last Glacial Maximum, rather than a saddle separating ice domes over Quebec-Labrador and Keewatin. Estimated rates of glacial erosion for the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets are compared against those predicted by the model. The model underestimates these rates because it underestimates the vigour of the quarrying process.},

	abstract = {The extent and style of shear deformation in sediments beneath modern glaciers and the geological evidence for such deformation in deposited sediments are reviewed. New evidence is presented from beneath a modern glacier of the spatial and temporal patterns of water pressure fluctuation and of time dependent patterns of deformation in sediments. It is concluded that in most experimental sites beneath soft-bedded modern glaciers, deformation is a significant or major contributor to glacier movement and the resultant discharge of till is large enough to make sediment deformation a major till forming process. Particular modes of deformation facilitate incorporation of underlying material into the till, whilst the capacity of a deforming till to absorb strain can protect the underlying strata from deformation, leading to the commonly found relationship where till overlies other strata with a sharp planar interface. It is argued that the almost ubiquitous occurrence of drumlins on the beds of former ice sheets is a reflection of the widespread occurrence of sediment deformation beneath them, with important implications for the coupling of ice sheet flow and bed properties. It is argued that the mechanical behaviour of the subglacial system is not simply determined by till properties but largely controlled by the subglacial water pressure regime determined by the nature of subglacial drainage. Results of field experiments show how the nature of the basal hydraulic system can play a vital role in controlling the coupling between the glacier and till deformation processes. They show that rapid glacier advances can produce undrained loading of sediments, that effective pressure may increase either upwards or downwards in a till according to the direction of drainage and that interstitial water pressures in subglacial sediments can show large and rapid variations, producing strong variations in the rate and distribution of strain and in the partitioning of basal movement between sliding and deformation.},

At Svínafellsjökull, southeast Iceland, we assess the extent to which two different processes of basal ice formation (regelation and glaciohydraulic supercooling) can be identified from ice-marginal sediments. Our results indicate that the sedimentary characteristics of deposits produced by these two processes can be distinguished from one another and that it may be possible to recognise evidence of these processes in Quaternary sediments and to reconstruct their spatial pervasiveness. Sediments derived from the melting of regelation basal ice have (i) a massive structure; (ii) a sediment matrix (0 to 10Ф) dominated by coarse sand; and (iii) a higher proportion of angular clasts than supercool basal ice and associated sediments. Sediments derived from “supercool” basal ice (i) can be either massive or layered; (ii) tend to have a silt-dominated matrix; and (iii) contain a slightly higher proportion of rounded and well-rounded clasts than regelation basal ice and sediments. Previous studies indicate that the dominance of silt within supercool basal ice may be unique to this process, and hence, supercooling should leave a readily recognisable signature in the sedimentary record. Our results from Svínafellsjökull lend support to that idea, although we suggest that further work is required to assess whether silt dominance is a process signature diagnostic of supercooling, and in particular, the extent to which subglacial sediment supply determines the sedimentary character of basal ice facies and associated sediments.},

Results indicate that the principal moraines are thrust-block moraines produced by basal freezing and deformation of glaciomarine sediment as the outlet glacier expands into a marine inlet. Preservation of detailed glaciomarine sedimentary structures and beds of marine shells suggests that the sediment was frozen during entrainment, transportation and deposition. The presence of low-angle faults in the moraines show that the moraines consist of an en echelon arrangement of thrust plates. The sedimentology, structure, thickness of the thrust plates, and inferred entrainment processes are consistent with Weertman's ice-debris accretion hypothesis for debris entrainment at the edge of cold ice sheets. A model of thrust-block moraine development produced by this study provides a framework for the interpretation of radiocarbon dates from marine macrofossils in the moraines.

Because glaciers concentrate runoff, streams generated by glaciers transport much sediment and may erode bedrock rapidly. Deforming glacier beds also can transport much sediment, particularly in marginal regions. Rapid sediment entrainment producing thick debris-rich basal zones may occur by regelation into subglacial materials, and by freeze-on from rising supercooled waters. Numerous other mechanisms may be important but primarily near ice margins, especially those of advancing or fluctuating glaciers. Several sediment-entrainment mechanisms may be active beneath a single glacier, but one process is likely to be dominant at any place and time.},

	abstract = {Glacial quarrying remains enigmatic despite being long recognized as a primary, perhaps the dominant, process by which glaciers erode bedrock. The rate-limiting process appears to be subglacial rock fracture due to ice-induced mechanical stresses.
To study this erosional process, a simple model of quarrying is developed for a glacier sliding over a periodic series of bedrock steps. Consideration of the balance of forces at the ice/rock interface and of the rate of cavity closure permits evaluation of ice-induced stresses on bedrock surfaces. The resulting stress distribution where ice loads are most concentrated near the corner of bedrock steps is evaluated using a simple elastic solution for the state of stress in a loaded quarter-plane. It is then used to determine whether fractures in the rock will grow, and to estimate the rate of progressive crack growth. Based on these crack-growth rates, an index of the quarrying rate is then calculated as a function of glaciological variables effective pressure and sliding velocity—and various bed parameteres. Considerable incentive exists for further analysis of quarrying, and for seeking field data to test the model.},

The analysis, which is constructed within a framework of modern glaciological views of processes near to the bed, is aimed at modeling abrasion under a temperate glacier whose basal layers contain only occasional rock fragments. It does not simulate abrasion by debris-rich ice or by subglacial drift. Calculations of abrasion-rates reduce to evaluations of the forces pressing rock fragments against the glacier bed and of the rates at which they are moved along the bed. The estimated viscous drag induced by ice flow toward the bed due to basal melting is generally the dominant contribution to this contact force. Although the analysis shares several important elements with the pioneering study of Boulton ([c1974]), sufficient fundamental differences in the modeling lead to distinctly different conclusions. Several new results are noteworthy: (1) other parameters being equal, abrasion will tend to be fastest where basal melting is most rapid, (2) glacier thickness does not affect abrasion through its influence on basal pressures, and (3) lodgement of rock fragments is only possible if the sliding velocity is very low, equivalent to the rate of basal melting.

Résumé
On présente les résultats préliminaires d’un modèle quantitatif de l’abrasion glaciaire. L’analyse, qui est conduit dans le cadre des perspectives glaciologiques modernes sur les phénomènes au voisinage du lit, a pour but de modéliser l’abrasion sous un glacier tempéré dont les niveaux de base ne contiennent qu’occasionnellement des fragments rocheux. Il ne simule pas l’abrasion par une glace riche en matériaux minéraux ou par l’entrainement sous-glaciaire. Les calculs de vitesses d’abrasion se réduisent à des estimations des forces qui pressent les fragments de rocher contre le lit du glacier et de la vitesse avec laquelle ces fragments sont déplacés le long du lit. L’estimation de la trainée visqueuse provoquée par le courant de glace vers le lit en raison de la fusion à la base constitue en général le facteur dominant à cette force de contact Bien que l’analyse distingue plusieurs éléments importants avec l’étudc pionniére de Boulton ([c1974]), des différences fondamentales suffisantes dans la modélisation conduisent à des conclusions distinctement différentes. Plusieurs résultats nouveaux valent d’être notés: (1) à égalité des autres paramètres, l’abrasion tendra à être la plus rapide lorsque la fusion à la base sera la plus active, (2) l’épaisseur du glacier n’affecte pas l’abrasion par l’intermédiaire de son influence sur les pressions à la base, et (3) le dépôt d’un fragment de roche n’est possible qui si la vitesse de glissement est très faible, èquivalente à la vitesse de la fusion à la base.

Zusammenfassung
Es werden vorläufige Ergebnisse eines quantitativen Modells der glazialen Abrasion vorgelegt. Die Analyse, die sich im Rahmen moderner glaziologischer Ansichten über die Vorgänge nahe am Untergrund hält, zielt auf die Modellierung der Abrasion unter einem temperierten Gletscher, dessen unterste Schichten nur gelegentlich Felsstücke enthalten; es simuliert nicht die Abrasion durch schuttreiches Eis oder subglazialen Schutt. Berechnungen von Abrasionsraten beschränken sich auf die Auswertung der Kräfte, die Felspartikel gegen das Felsbett anpressen, und der Geschwindigkeit, mit denen sie über das Bett bewegt werden. Die geschätzte viskose Schleppkraft, hervorgerufen durch den Eisfluss gegen das Bett infolge von Schmelzvorgängen am Untergrund, ist im allgemeinen der wichtigste Beitrag zu dieser Kontaktkraft. Obwohl dieses Modell einige wichtige Elemente mit der grundlegenden Studie von Boulton ([c1974]) gemeinsam hat, führen wesentliche Unter-schiede im Modellaufbau zu erheblich verschiedenen Folgerungen. Einige neue Ergebnisse erscheinen bemerkenswert: (1) Bleiben andere Parameter unverändert, so erreicht die Abrasion ihre Höchstwerte dort, wo das Schmelzen am Untergrund am schnellsten vor sich geht; (2) Die Gletscherdicke wirkt sich auf die Abrasion trotz ihres Einflusses auf den Druck am Untergrund nicht aus; (3) Die Anhäufung von Felsstücken ist nur möglich, wenn die Gleitgeschwindigkeit sehr niedrig ist, entsprechend der Geschwindigkeit des Schmelzens am Untergrund.},

	abstract = {Sediment yields from glacierized basins are used to quantify erosion rates on seasonal to decadal timescales as well as conditions at the glacier bed, and eskers hold valuable information about past subglacial hydraulic conditions in their spatial organization, geometry, and sedimentary structures. Ultimately, eskers are a record of past glacio-fluvial sediment transport, but there is currently no physical model for this process. We develop a 1-D model of morphodynamics in semicircular bedrock-floored subglacial channels. We adapt a sediment conservation law developed for mixed alluvial-bedrock conditions to subglacial channels. Channel evolution is a function of melt opening by viscous heat dissipation from flowing water and creep closure of the overlying ice, to which we add the closure or enlargement due to sediment deposition or removal, respectively. We apply the model to an idealized land-terminating glacier and find that temporary sediment accumulation in the vicinity of the terminus, or the formation of an incipient esker, is inherent to the dynamics of the channelized water flow. The alluviation of the bed combined with the pressurized channel flow produces unexpected patterns of sediment evacuation: We show that the direction of hysteresis between sediment and water discharge is not necessarily linked to a supply- or transport-limited system, as has been hypothesized for proglacial sediment yields. We also find that the deposition of an incipient esker is a function of a compromise between water discharge and sediment supply, but perhaps more importantly, ice-surface slope and the temporal pattern of water delivery to the bed.},

The model is based on a consideration of the total mass budget of a glacier, whereas ice mechanics are fully parameterized. The calving rate at the glacier terminus is assumed to be proportional to the water depth. We show that the formation of a morainic shoal has a profound influence on the response of a tidewater glacier to climatic forcing. For a slow periodic forcing of the equilibrium-line altitude, the model glacier advances steadily into the estuary, builds up a submarine terminal moraine, and then retreats rapidly when a critical point is hit. For a slowly increasing equilibrium-line altitude, at a rate as low as 1 m per 5 years, we find terminus retreat rates of up to 10 km in 50 years. Our model suggests that, although the response of tidewater glaciers to external forcing is strongly nonlinear, the onset of retreat is controlled by climate change.},

	abstract = {In high-latitude fjord ecosystems, the spring bloom accounts for a major part of the annual primary production and thus provides a crucial energy supply to the marine food web. However, the environmental factors that control the timing and intensity of these spring blooms remain uncertain. In 2013, we studied the spring bloom dynamics in Godthåbsfjord, a large fjord system adjacent to the Greenland Ice Sheet. Our surveys revealed that the spring bloom did not initiate in the inner stratified part of the fjord system but only started farther away from tidewater outlet glaciers. A combination of out-fjord winds and coastal inflows drove an upwelling in the inner part of the fjord during spring (April–May), which supplied nutrient-rich water to the surface layer. This surface water was subsequently transported out-fjord, and due to this circulation regime, the biomass accumulation of phytoplankton was displaced away from the glaciers. In late May, the upwelling weakened and the dominant wind direction changed, thus reversing the direction of the surface water transport. Warmer water was now transported toward the inner fjord, and a bloom was observed close to the glacier terminus. Overall, our findings imply that the timing, intensity, and location of the spring blooms in Godthåbsfjord are controlled by a combination of upwelling strength and wind forcing. Together with sea ice cover, the hydrodynamic regime hence plays a crucial role in structuring food web dynamics of the fjord ecosystem.},

	abstract = {To first order, subglacial discharge depends on climate, which determines precipitation fluxes and glacier mass balance, and the rate of glacier volume change. For tidewater glaciers, large and rapid changes in glacier volume can occur independent of climate change due to strong glacier dynamic feedbacks. Using an idealized tidewater glacier model, we show that these feedbacks produce secular variations in subglacial discharge that are influenced by subglacial topography. Retreat along retrograde bed slopes (into deep water) results in rapid surface lowering and coincident increases in subglacial discharge. Consequently, submarine melting of glacier termini, which depends on subglacial discharge and ocean thermal forcing, also increases during retreat into deep water. Both subglacial discharge and submarine melting subsequently decrease as glacier termini retreat out of deep water and approach new steady state equilibria. In our simulations, subglacial discharge reached peaks that were 6–17\% higher than preretreat values, with the highest values occurring during retreat from narrow sills, and submarine melting increased by 14\% for unstratified fjords and 51\% for highly stratified fjords. Our results therefore indicate that submarine melting acts in concert with iceberg calving to cause tidewater glacier termini to be unstable on retrograde beds. The full impact of submarine melting on tidewater glacier stability remains uncertain, however, due to poor understanding of the coupling between submarine melting and iceberg calving.},

Icebergs transport debris from ice masses into the glacimarine environment, but iceberg production, debris content and sedimentation rate will vary with glacier dynamics and the nature of marine waters. A model incorporating glaciological and oceanographic parameters calculates the flux of debris calved in icebergs, iceberg melt rates and sedimentation rates with distance from calving tidewater ice fronts. The flux of basal debris calved through a 1 m width of tidewater margin is (hd c/100) vc, where hd and c are basal debris-rich ice thickness and sediment content (\%), and vc is iceberg calving rate. Iceberg basal melting for any horizontal interval (dx) away from the calving glacier is dy = (Mb dx)/vb, where Mb is iceberg melt rate and vb is horizontal iceberg velocity. Sediment release for any x increment depends on iceberg debris concentration and previous berg melt history. Model parameters vary with the nature of climatic conditions, on a continuum from cold polar environments (e.g. High Canadian Arctic, Antarctic Peninsula), through sub-polar environments (e.g. Baffin Island, Svalbard) to more temperate environments (e.g. SE Alaska). These parameters include: glacier flow velocity, glacier thermal regime, basal debris-rich ice thickness, and marine water temperature. Model results suggest that iceberg sedimentation rates are lowest for high polar settings, and most rapid in warm maritime and some sub-polar areas. However, icebergs in cold waters transport debris to significantly greater distances from the parent glacier.

	abstract = {Of the primary pathways for the dispersal of sediment in fjords, only ice-contact processes are unique to fjords under the influence of glaciers. The effects of ice-front melting are found to be overwhelmed by the influences of glaciofluvial discharge and iceberg calving. Ice-front melting is, however, more important for side-entry glaciers compared to fjord-head trunk glaciers. Submarine discharge is almost always in the form of vertically rising buoyant jets. Underflows in marine fjords are considered rare and no direct evidence exists to support their importance or even existence. The release rate of supraglacial sediment due to calving depends on the distribution of supraglacial material and the style of calving. Because iceberg calving and overturning can create solitary shallow-water waves (tsunamis), ice-rafted sediment may be deposited well above the high tide line. Ice-contact processes cause most sediment to be deposited very near the ice terminus. Thus for a stable ice front position, the rate of sediment accumulation decreases rapidly with distance from the glacier. For an unstable position, sediment accumulation depends on the rate of ice terminus retreat or advance. Away from the ice front, sediment deposition is controlled by circulation in the upper water column. The distance a particle is carried out into the fjord will depend on surface plume velocity and particle removal processes. Across-basin effects include the influence of the Coriolis and centrifugal forces acting on the surface plume. The influence of floating ice, i.e., sea ice, icebergs or floating ice shelves, on sediment dispersal within “arctic” glacier-influenced fjords is considered minor although very system dependent. Similarly, the range of deep-water currents in silled fjords is highly variable although most currents arise from the flushing of deep water. Deep-water renewals may import or export sediment from fjords, depending on the season of the flushing event — a process considered minor compared to other depositional processes. In the case of fjords without sills, tidal currents can be important at depth. Redepositional pathways are many and varied, all very system dependent. Much of the sediment deposited at the ice terminus is subsequently remobilized, through the action of iceberg calving, ice-push phenomena, or simply through slope instabilities associated with a rapidly and vertically accreting sediment mass.},

Their combined rate of mass loss doubled in less than a year in 2004 and then decreased in 2006 to near the previous rates, likely as a result of fast re-equilibration of calving-front geometry after retreat. Total mass loss is a fraction of concurrent gravity-derived estimates, pointing to an alternative source of loss and the need for high-resolution observations of outlet dynamics and glacier geometry for sea-level rise predictions.

	abstract = {Three variables control the type of glacial debris source and where and when debris is introduced to an ocean: (1) type of glacial ice source (ice sheet or valley glacier); (2) condition of a grounded glacier (melting/freezing or frozen base and cold or warm internal ice); and (3) type of glacier front (ice shelf or tidewater). Using these variables in different combinations eight glacimarine regimes are postulated to exist. By integrating information from Holocene sediment and Pleistocene glacimarine sequences with the eight inductive regimes, lithofacies relationships are predicted and modelled. The models show a complexity of glacimarine lithofacies. The importance of recognizing this complexity lies in realistic interpretations of ancient sequences. Ice shelf sediment may be limited in the geologic record because of tectonic and climatic constraints required for ice shelf formation. Alternatively, in some tidewater glacier regimes larger volumes of glacimarine sediment are produced than in ice shelf regimes. Ice-proximal sediment is distinctive, especially near subglacial meltwater stream effluxes. Ice shelves and tidewater glaciers may produce similar ice-proximal lithofacies (e.g. morainal bank associations and laminites) in certain regimes. However, details of lithofacies may aid in distinguishing ice shelf from tidewater regimes. Ice shelf and tidewater iceberg zone sediment can be distinguished from each other if basal and high-level englacial debris can be distinguished. Ice shelf zone sediment out from the grounding line has a basal debris source. High-level englacial debris is deposited in more distal ice shelf zones resulting in sediment by-pass. In corresponding positions of a tidewater glacier regime, iceberg rafted debris comprises mixed basal and high-level englacial debris. Deeper water zones receive large volumes of sediment when a melting/freezing-base grounding line is at the edge of a continental shelf. When the grounding line retreats sediment supply may be drastically reduced because of a back-sloping continental shelf and trapping by morainal banks. Cool water bioclastic carbonates may accumulate once a grounding line has retreated. Although ice shelf iceberg zones are more extensive than those in tidewater regimes, ice shelf icebergs have low debris content and resulting ice-rafted debris may be scarce. The smallest volume of sediment is produced by a frozen-base ice sheet ending as a tidewater front, and the largest volume by a melting/freezing-base valley, tidewater glacier. Glacimarine sediment has a relatively high preservation potential near continental interiors or margins. However, at continental margins mass flow (olistostrome) and tectonic (melange) deposits may be preserved with glacimarine diamictites. These deposits may be difficult to distinguish from each other, especially if metamorphosed such as at a convergent margin. The models presented do not fully represent the glacimarine environment, because many other variables are omitted. However, the principal concepts of generating glacimarine lithofacies associations are considered. Continued research will verify if each regime exists and will provide data on those regimes that exist today to compare and modify these models.},

	abstract = {Rapid mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet is affecting sea level and, through increased freshwater discharge, ocean circulation, sea-ice, biogeochemistry, and marine ecosystems around Greenland. Key to interpreting ongoing and projecting future ice loss, and its impact on the ocean, is understanding exchanges of heat, freshwater, and nutrients that occur at Greenland’s marine margins. Processes governing these exchanges are poorly understood because of limited observations from the regions where glaciers terminate into the ocean and the challenge to model the spatial and temporal scales involved. Thus, notwithstanding their importance, ice sheet/ocean exchanges are poorly represented or not accounted for in models used for projection studies. Widespread community consensus maintains that concurrent and long-term records of glaciological, oceanic, and atmospheric parameters at the ice sheet/ocean margins are key to addressing this knowledge gap by informing understanding, and constraining and validating models. Through a series of workshops and documents endorsed by the community-at-large, a framework for an international, collaborative, Greenland Ice sheet-Ocean Observing System (GrIOOS), that addresses societal needs for the impact of a changing Greenland Ice Sheet, has been proposed. This system would consist of a set of ocean, glacier, and atmosphere essential variables to be collected at a number of diverse sites around Greenland for a minimum of two decades. Internationally agreed upon data protocols and data sharing policies would guarantee uniformity and availability of the information for the broader community. Its development, maintenance, and funding will require close international collaboration. Engagement of end-users, local people, and groups already active in these areas, as well as synergy with ongoing, related, or complementary networks will be key to its success and effectiveness.},

Here we apply a 3-D coupled ice sheet and sediment model from 40 Ma to the present, with the goal of directly linking ice-sheet variations with the sediment record. The ice-sheet model uses vertically averaged ice dynamics and parameterized grounding-line flux. The sediment model includes quarrying of bedrock, sub-ice transport, and marine deposition. Atmospheric and oceanic forcing are determined by uniform shifts to modern climatology in proportion to records of atmospheric CO2, deep-sea-core δ18O, and orbital insolation variations. The model is run continuously over the last 40 Myr at coarse resolution (80 or 160 km), modeling post-Eocene ice, landscape evolution and off-shore sediment packages in a single self-consistent simulation. Strata and unconformities are tracked by recording times of deposition within the model sediment stacks, which can be compared directly with observed seismic profiles. The initial bedrock topography is initialized to 34 Ma geologic reconstructions, or an iterative procedure is used that yields independent estimates of paleo bedrock topography. Preliminary results are compared with recognized Cenozoic ice-sheet variations, modern sediment distributions and seismic profiles, and modern and paleo bedrock topographies.},

We also describe a version optimized through Cython, that is found to match the speed of C++. The solvers are written from scratch in Python, both the mesh, the MPI domain decomposition, and the temporal integrators. The solvers have been verified and benchmarked on the Shaheen supercomputer at the KAUST supercomputing laboratory, and we are able to show very good scaling up to several thousand cores. A very important part of the implementation is the mesh decomposition (we implement both slab and pencil decompositions) and 3D parallel Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). The mesh decomposition and FFT routines have been implemented in Python using serial FFT routines (either NumPy, pyFFTW or any other serial FFT module), NumPy array manipulations and with MPI communications handled by MPI for Python (mpi4py). We show how we are able to execute a 3D parallel FFT in Python for a slab mesh decomposition using 4 lines of compact Python code, for which the parallel performance on Shaheen is found to be slightly better than similar routines provided through the FFTW library. For a pencil mesh decomposition 7 lines of code is required to execute a transform.},

While recent studies have shown that water plays a major role in modulating sliding velocities, the impact it might have on erosion rates is still unclear. Here we incorporate subglacial hydrology into a glacial erosion model that is based on a sliding rule. Our results explicitly highlight that adding subglacial hydrology has profound impacts on the temporal and spatial patterns of glacial erosion. First, it suggests that erosion might mainly occur during melting seasons, when subglacial water pressure is large and effective pressure is low (i.e., before the channels fully develop and reduce the water pressure at the ice bedrock interface), which promotes sliding and erosion. Second, the distribution of erosion is bimodal with a peak at the equilibrium line altitude and, as we demonstrate, enhanced erosion at much lower altitudes within the ablation area where water due to melting abounds. This has important implications because it explains why glacial erosion can simultaneously set a limit on the mean elevation of mountain ranges and carve large fjords or glacial lakes.},

Sediment sampling, in conjunction with oceanographic and glacial dynamics data, has also enabled the discrimination of sediment types and their facies associations. Deposits are strongly controlled by: sea-water characteristics, position and sediment discharge of melt-water streams, iceberg calving, and rate of glacierfront retreat. Five distinct facies associations have been found to reflect glacier-fjord regimes. The facies associations and ice-fjord conditions responsible for them form the basis for constructing a preliminary model for glacimarine sedimentation by tidewater glaciers. The model can be used to predict (i) rapid retreat of an actively calving ice front, (ii) slow retreat or stabilization of a calving ice front at a channel constriction, (iii) stabilization of a melting (very rarely calving) ice front when the glacier base is near tidewater elevation, and (iv) large outwash delta progradation into a fjord when the ice front retreats onto land. This model can be used to interpret facies associations found in a stratigraphic record.},

	abstract = {Simple insights from the physics of ice, water and sediment place constraints on the possible sediment-transport behavior of glaciers and ice sheets. Because glaciers concentrate runoff, streams generated by glaciers transport much sediment and may erode bedrock rapidly. Deforming glacier beds also can transport much sediment, particularly in marginal regions. Rapid sediment entrainment producing thick debris-rich basal zones may occur by regelation into subglacial materials, and by freeze-on from rising supercooled waters. Numerous other mechanisms may be important but primarily near ice margins, especially those of advancing or fluctuating glaciers. Several sediment-entrainment mechanisms may be active beneath a single glacier, but one process is likely to be dominant at any place and time.},

Applications are discussed in fluid dynamics, nonlinear solid mechanics, and coupled problems describing fluid–structure interaction. The need for an adequate mesh-update strategy is underlined, and various automatic mesh-displacement prescription algorithms are reviewed. This includes mesh-regularization methods essentially based on geometrical concepts, as well as mesh-adaptation techniques aimed at optimizing the computational mesh according to some error indicator. Emphasis is then placed on particular issues related to the modeling of compressible and incompressible flow and nonlinear solid mechanics problems. This includes the treatment of convective terms in the conservation equations for mass, momentum, and energy, as well as a discussion of stress-update procedures for materials with history-dependent constitutive behavior.},

	abstract = {Fast-flowing outlet glaciers currently drain the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS), delivering ice, meltwater and debris to the fjords around Greenland. Although such glaciers strongly affect the ice sheet's mass balance, their glacimarine processes and associated products are still poorly understood. This study provides a detailed analysis of lithological and geophysical data from Disko Bay and the Vaigat Strait in central West Greenland. Disko Bay is strongly influenced by Jakobshavn Isbræ, Greenland's fastest-flowing glacier, which currently drains ∼7\% of the ice sheet. Streamlined glacial landforms record the former flow of an expanded Jakobshavn Isbræ and adjacent GIS outlets through Disko Bay and the Vaigat Strait towards the continental shelf. Thirteen vibrocores contain a complex set of lithofacies including diamict, stratified mud, interbedded mud and sand, and bioturbated mud deposited by (1) suspension settling from meltwater plumes and the water column, (2) sediment gravity flows, and (3) iceberg rafting and ploughing. The importance of meltwater-related processes to glacimarine sedimentation in West Greenland fjords and bays is emphasised by the abundance of mud preserved in the cores. Radiocarbon dates constrain the position of the ice margin during deglaciation, and suggest that Jakobshavn Isbræ had retreated into central Disko Bay before 10.6 cal ka BP and to beyond Isfjeldsbanken by 7.6–7.1 cal ka BP. Sediment accumulation rates were up to 1.7 cm a−1 for ice-proximal glacimarine mud, and ∼0.007–0.05 cm a−1 for overlying distal sediments. In addition to elucidating the deglacial retreat history of Jakobshavn Isbræ, our findings show that the glacimarine sedimentary processes in West Greenland are similar to those in East Greenland, and that variability in such processes is more a function of time and glacier proximity than of geographic location and associated climatic regime.},

This volume brings numerous state-of-the-art research contributions together, each relating to a different physical setting, spatial scale, process or investigative technique.

	abstract = {High precipitation from Gulf of Alaska air masses can locally reach up to 800 cm a−1. This precipitation on tectonically active mountains creates cool-temperate glaciation with extremely active erosion and continuously renewed resources. High basal debris loads up to 1.5 m thick of pure debris and rapid glacial flow, which can be more than 3000 m a−1, combine to produce large volumes of siliciclastic glacimarine sediment at some of the highest sediment accumulation rates on record. At tidewater fronts of valley glaciers, sediment accumulation rates can be over 13 m a−1 and deltas commonly grow at about 106 m3 a−1. Major processes influencing glacimarine sedimentation are glacial transport and glacier-contact deposition, meltwater (subaerial and submarine) and runoff transport and deposition, iceberg rafting and gouging, sea-ice transport, wave action and storm reworking, tidal transport and deposition, alongshelf transport, sliding and slumping and gravity flows, eolian transport, and biogenic production and reworking. Processes are similar in both shelf and fjord settings; however, different intensities of some processes create different facies associations and geometries. The tectonoclimatic regime also controls morphology because bedrock structure is modified by glacial action. Major glacimarine depositional systems are all siliciclastic. They are subglacial, marginal-morainal bank and submarine outwash, and proglacial/paraglacial-fluvial/deltaic, beach, tidal flat/estuary, glacial fjord, marine outwash fjord and continental shelf. Future research should include study of long cores with extensive dating and more seismic surveys to evaluate areal and temporal extent of glacial facies and glaciation; time-series oceanographic data, sidescan sonar surveys and submersible dives to evaluate modern processes; biogenic diversity and production to evaluate paleoecological, paleobiogeographic and biofacies analysis; and detailed comparisons of exposed older rock of the Yakataga Formation to evaluate how glacial style has evolved over 6.3 Ma.},

	abstract = {We performed a quantitative comparison of brittle thrust wedge experiments to evaluate the variability among analogue models and to appraise the reproducibility and limits of model interpretation. Fifteen analogue modeling laboratories participated in this benchmark initiative. Each laboratory received a shipment of the same type of quartz and corundum sand and all laboratories adhered to a stringent model building protocol and used the same type of foil to cover base and sidewalls of the sandbox. Sieve structure, sifting height, filling rate, and details on off-scraping of excess sand followed prescribed procedures. Our analogue benchmark shows that even for simple plane-strain experiments with prescribed stringent model construction techniques, quantitative model results show variability, most notably for surface slope, thrust spacing and number of forward and backthrusts. One of the sources of the variability in model results is related to slight variations in how sand is deposited in the sandbox. Small changes in sifting height, sifting rate, and scraping will result in slightly heterogeneous material bulk densities, which will affect the mechanical properties of the sand, and will result in lateral and vertical differences in peak and boundary friction angles, as well as cohesion values once the model is constructed. Initial variations in basal friction are inferred to play the most important role in causing model variability. Our comparison shows that the human factor plays a decisive role, and even when one modeler repeats the same experiment, quantitative model results still show variability. Our observations highlight the limits of up-scaling quantitative analogue model results to nature or for making comparisons with numerical models. The frictional behavior of sand is highly sensitive to small variations in material state or experimental set-up, and hence, it will remain difficult to scale quantitative results such as number of thrusts, thrust spacing, and pop-up width from model to nature.},

Sediments deposited in fjords provide an important record of glaciological response to changing climatic conditions. The model simulates the formation, drift, and melt of a population of icebergs utilizing Monte Carlo–based techniques with a number of underlying parametric probability distributions to describe the stochastic behavior of iceberg formation and dynamics. The model captures iceberg dynamics and melt in fjord environments and has been applied to Kangerdlugssuaq Fjord in east Greenland as an example of an iceberg-dominated sedimentary environment. Sedimentation has been simulated over the past 1500 years, encompassing the climatic intervals of the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and the Little Ice Age (LIA). Model results have been compared with the observed sedimentary record. The model demonstrates that the glaciological regime, e.g., basal debris thickness, mean annual calving rate, mean iceberg size, plays a more important role than the direct influence of climate (ocean and air temperatures) on iceberg sedimentation rate, although often changes in climate result in changes to the glaciological regime.},

Julia is designed to be easy and fast. Julia questions notions generally held as “laws of nature” by practitioners of numerical computing:
1. High-level dynamic programs have to be slow,
2. One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deploy- ment, and
3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts.
We introduce the Julia programming language and its design — a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming.
Julia shows that one can have machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.},

Despite its critical importance, problems of process complexity and scale hinder efforts to represent the influence of submarine melting in ice-sheet-scale models. Here we propose parameterizing tidewater glacier terminus position as a simple linear function of submarine melting, with submarine melting in turn estimated as a function of subglacial discharge and ocean temperature. The relationship is tested, calibrated and validated using datasets of terminus position, subglacial discharge and ocean temperature covering the full ice sheet and surrounding ocean from the period 1960–2018. We demonstrate a statistically significant link between multi-decadal tidewater glacier terminus position change and submarine melting and show that the proposed parameterization has predictive power when considering a population of glaciers. An illustrative 21st century projection is considered, suggesting that tidewater glaciers in Greenland will undergo little further retreat in a low-emission RCP2.6 scenario. In contrast, a high-emission RCP8.5 scenario results in a median retreat of 4.2 km, with a quarter of tidewater glaciers experiencing retreat exceeding 10 km. Our study provides a long-term and ice-sheet-wide assessment of the sensitivity of tidewater glaciers to submarine melting and proposes a practical and empirically validated means of incorporating ocean forcing into models of the Greenland ice sheet.},

In this study, we present records of basal melting at a unique spatial and temporal resolution for East Antarctica, derived from autonomous phase-sensitive radars. These records show spatial and temporal variations of basal melting in 2017 and 2018 at Nivlisen, an ice shelf in central Dronning Maud Land. The annually averaged basal melt rates are in general moderate ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}∼0.8{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;m\&thinsp;yr{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}). Radar profiling of the ice shelf shows variable ice thickness from smooth beds to basal crevasses and channels. The highest basal melt rates (3.9\&thinsp;m\&thinsp;yr{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) were observed close to a grounded feature near the ice shelf front. Daily time-varying measurements reveal a seasonal melt signal 4\&thinsp;km from the ice shelf front, at an ice draft of 130\&thinsp;m, where the highest daily basal melt rates occurred in summer (up to 5.6\&thinsp;m\&thinsp;yr{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}). In comparison with wind, air temperatures, and sea ice cover from reanalysis and satellite data, the seasonality in basal melt rates indicates that summer-warmed ocean surface water was pushed by wind beneath the ice shelf front. We observed a different melt regime 35\&thinsp;km into the ice shelf cavity, at an ice draft of 280\&thinsp;m, with considerably lower basal melt rates (annual average of 0.4\&thinsp;m\&thinsp;yr{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) and no seasonality. We conclude that warm deep-ocean water at present has a limited effect on the basal melting of Nivlisen. On the other hand, a warming in surface waters, as a result of diminishing sea ice cover, has the potential to increase basal melting near the ice shelf front. Continuous in situ monitoring of Antarctic ice shelves is needed to understand the complex mechanisms involved in ice shelf–ocean interactions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Ice sheets and glaciers have been shown to deliver bioavailable iron to the coastal and open ocean in the form of sediment released from the base of icebergs2,3 and glacially derived dust4. More direct measurements from glacial runoff are limited, but iron concentrations are thought to be in the nanomolar range5. Here we present measurements of dissolved and particulate iron concentrations in glacial meltwater from the southwest margin of the Greenland ice sheet. We report micromolar concentrations of dissolved and particulate iron. Particulate iron concentrations were on average an order of magnitude higher than those of dissolved iron, and around 50\% of this particulate iron was deemed to be potentially bioavailable, on the basis of experimental leaching. If our observations are scalable to the entire ice sheet, then the annual flux of dissolved and potentially bioavailable particulate iron to the North Atlantic Ocean would be approximately 0.3 Tg. This is comparable to dust-derived soluble iron inputs to the North Atlantic. We suggest that glacial runoff serves as a significant source of bioavailable iron to surrounding coastal oceans, which is likely to increase as melting of the Greenland ice sheet escalates under climate warming.},

A new model, termed “BQART” in recognition of those factors, accounts for these varied inﬂuences. When applied to a database of 488 rivers, the BQART model showed no ensemble over- or underprediction, had a bias of just 3\% across six orders of magnitude in observational values, and accounted for 96\% of the between-river variation in the long-term (ע30 years) sediment load or yield of these rivers. The geographical range of the 488 rivers covers 63\% of the global land surface and is highly representative of global geology, climate, and socioeconomic conditions. Based strictly on geological parameters (basin area, relief, lithology, ice erosion), 65\% of the between-river sediment load is explained. Climatic factors (precipitation and temperature) account for an additional 14\% of the variability in global patterns in load. Anthropogenic factors account for an additional 16\% of the between-river loads, although with ever more dams being constructed or decommissioned and socioeconomic conditions and infrastructure in ﬂux, this contribution is temporally variable. The glacial factor currently contributes only 1\% of the signal represented by our globally distributed database, but it would be much more important during and just after major glaciations. The BQART model makes possible the quantiﬁcation of the inﬂuencing factors (e.g., climate, basin area, ice cover) within individual basins, to better interpret the terrestrial signal in marine sedimentary records. The BQART model predicts the long-term ﬂux of sediment delivered by rivers; it does not predict the episodicity (e.g., typhoons, earthquakes) of this delivery.},

Among the numerous parameterizations that have been developed to predict river channel evolution, the stream power law, which links erosion rate to drainage area and slope, remains the most widely used. Despite its simple formulation, its power lies in its capacity to reproduce many of the characteristic features of natural systems (the concavity of river profile, the propagation of knickpoints, etc.). However, the three main coefficients that are needed to relate erosion rate to slope and drainage area in the stream power law remain poorly constrained. In this study, we present a novel approach to constrain the stream power law coefficients under the detachment-limited mode by combining a highly efficient landscape evolution model, FastScape, which solves the stream power law under arbitrary geometries and boundary conditions and an inversion algorithm, the neighborhood algorithm. A misfit function is built by comparing topographic data of a reference landscape supposedly at steady state and the same landscape subject to both uplift and erosion over one time step. By applying the method to a synthetic landscape, we show that different landscape characteristics can be retrieved, such as the concavity of river profiles and the steepness index. When applied on a real catchment (in the Whataroa region of the South Island in New Zealand), this approach provides well-resolved constraints on the concavity of river profiles and the distribution of uplift as a function of distance to the Alpine Fault, the main active structure in the area.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Wavecut platforms mantled by 2–6 m of marine terrace cover deposits are separated by 10–50 m tall decaying sea cliffs. Paleocliff edges become more rounded with age, yet the details of the profiles and frequent bedrock exposure on the upper slopes imply weathering-limited transport. Five bedrock stream channels etched through the marine terrace sequence display one to three distinct convexities in their longitudinal profiles. Detailed hand level surveys of the hillslopes and of the stream channel longitudinal profiles constrain hillslope evolution and channel incision components of a numerical model of landscape evolution. We account for regolith production as a function of regolith depth. In accord with the field observation that hillslope processes are presently dominated by the activities of burrowing rodents, the transport process is taken to be diffusive. Stream incision is assumed to be controlled by stream power, for which we use the surrogate of local drainage area-slope product. Best fits of the numerical model to field data imply: hillslope diffusivity is 10 m2 kyr−1; regolith production rate on bare bedrock is 0.3 m kyr−1, and falls off rapidly with regolith cover, and the constant controlling the efficiency of stream incision is 5 to 7×10−7m−1 kyr1.},

A model incorporating glacioiogical and oceanographic parameters calculates the flux of debris calved in icebergs, iceberg melt rates and sedimentation rates with distance from calving tidewater ice fronts. The flux of basal debris calved through a 1 m width of tidewater margin is (hd c/lO0) vc, where hd and c are basal debris-rich ice thickness and sediment content (\%), and vc is iceberg calving rate. Iceberg basal melting for any horizontal interval (dx) away from the calving glacier is dy = (Mh dx)/\%, where Mb is iceberg melt rate and vb is horizontal iceberg velocity. Sediment release for any x increment depends on iceberg debris concentration and previous berg melt history. Model parameters vary with the nature of climatic conditions, on a continuum from cold polar environments (e.g. High Canadian Arctic, Antarctic Peninsula), through sub-polar environments (e.g. Baffin Island, Svalbard) to more temperate environments (e.g. SE Alaska). These parameters include: glacier flow velocity, glacier thermal regime, basal debris-rich ice thickness, and marine water temperature. Model results suggest that iceberg sedimentation rates are lowest for high polar settings, and most rapid in warm maritime and some sub-polar areas. However, icebergs in cold waters transport debris to significantly greater distances from the parent glacier. The model provides calculations of order of magnitude rates of iceberg sedimentation in varying glacimarine settings.},

Within this volcanic landscape, many topographically closed basins exist as a result of compressional folding and explosion pitting during eruption. The landscape has evolved from an initial state of no regolith cover at 40 ± 5 ka to its modern state, which has highly weathered regolith ranging from 0 to 3+ m, with local thickness values controlled primarily by topographic position. Our models constrain the maximum rate of regolith production in the study area to be in the range of 0.02 to 0.12 m kyr−1 and the rate of colluvial transport per unit slope gradient to be in the range of 0.2 to 2.7 m2 kyr−1, with higher values in areas with more aboveground biomass. We conclude that a depth-dependent colluvial transport model better predicts the observed spatial distribution of regolith thickness compared to a model that has no depth dependence. This study adds to the database of estimates for rates of regolith production and transport in the western United States and shows how dated landscapes can be used to improve our understanding of the coevolution of landscapes and regolith cover.},

On Apollo 17, monitoring took place from December 1972 to September 1977. The investigators involved in the HFE examined and archived only data from the time of deployment to December 1974. The present authors recovered and restored major portions of the previously unarchived HFE data from January 1975 through September 1977. The HFE investigators noted that temperature of the regolith well below the reach of insolation cycles ( 1 m) rose gradually through December 1974 at both sites. The restored data showed that the subsurface warming continued until the end of observations in 1977. Simultaneously, the thermal gradient decreased, because the warming was more pronounced at shallower depths. The present study has examined potential causes for the warming. Recently acquired images of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera over the two landing sites show that the regolith on the paths of the astronauts turned darker, lowering the albedo. We suggest that, as a result of the astronauts' activities, solar heat intake by the regolith increased slightly on average, and that resulted in the observed warming. Simple analytical heat conduction models with constant regolith thermal properties can show that an abrupt increase in surface temperature of 1.6 to 3.5 K at the time of probe deployment best duplicates the magnitude and the timing of the observed subsurface warmings at both Apollo sites.},

	abstract = {Sediment cores from three East Greenland fjords contain sediment lithofacies and depositional processes in an iceberg dominated glacial marine setting. Three major lithofacies, diamicton, fine-grained mud, and sand, are deposited by two processes, sediment rain-out and sediment gravity flows. The sediments in Kangerlussuaq Fjord are predominately fine-grained muds deposited by rain-out from icebergs and glacier meltwater, with sediment gravity flows acting as secondary agents of deposition. Miki Fjord records rain-out of fine-grained muds from a river plume emanating from a proglacial delta at the fjord head. Alternating units of diamicton and fine-grained mud in Nansen Fjord are deposited by sediment rain-out from icebergs; particle size is governed by the oceanographic conditions in the fjord at the time of deposition. Despite their proximity to each other, each fjord is distinguished by a distinct sedimentological signature: Kangerlussuaq Fjord has low total organic carbon contact, Miki Fjord has high mass magnetic susceptibility, and Nansen Fjord has high amounts of ice-rafted debris. Comparison of the East Greenland iceberg dominated and Alaska glacial meltwater dominated environments indicates few major differences between sediments deposited in these two settings. This similarity raises doubt as to how well glacial marine sedimentary sequences can be used to interpret and reconstruct differences between glacial marine environments in the past without knowledge of sediment accumulation rates, environmental conditions at the time of sediment deposition, and comparable sedimentological data between studies.},

	abstract = {We address the question of quantifying uncertainty associated with autogenic pattern variability in a channelized transport system by means of a modern geostatistical method. This question has considerable relevance for practical subsurface applications as well, particularly those related to uncertainty quantification relying on Bayesian approaches. Specifically, we show how the autogenic variability in a laboratory experiment can be represented and reproduced by a multiple-point geostatistical prior uncertainty model. The latter geostatistical method requires selection of a limited set of training images from which a possibly infinite set of geostatistical model realizations, mimicking the training image patterns, can be generated. To that end, we investigate two methods to determine how many training images and what training images should be provided to reproduce natural autogenic variability. The first method relies on distance-based clustering of overhead snapshots of the experiment; the second method relies on a rate of change quantification by means of a computer vision algorithm termed the demon algorithm. We show quantitatively that with either training image selection method, we can statistically reproduce the natural variability of the delta formed in the experiment. In addition, we study the nature of the patterns represented in the set of training images as a representation of the “eigenpatterns” of the natural system. The eigenpattern in the training image sets display patterns consistent with previous physical interpretations of the fundamental modes of this type of delta system: a highly channelized, incisional mode; a poorly channelized, depositional mode; and an intermediate mode between the two.},

	abstract = {Icebergs transport debris from ice masses into the glacimarine environment, but iceberg production, debris content and sedimentation rate will vary with glacier dynamics and the nature of marine waters. A model incorporating glacioiogical and oceanographic parameters calculates the flux of debris calved in icebergs, iceberg melt rates and sedimentation rates with distance from calving tidewater ice fronts. The flux of basal debris calved through a 1 m width of tidewater margin is (hd c/lO0) vc, where hd and c are basal debris-rich ice thickness and sediment content (\%), and vc is iceberg calving rate. Iceberg basal melting for any horizontal interval (dx) away from the calving glacier is dy = (Mh dx)/\%, where Mb is iceberg melt rate and vb is horizontal iceberg velocity. Sediment release for any x increment depends on iceberg debris concentration and previous berg melt history. Model parameters vary with the nature of climatic conditions, on a continuum from cold polar environments (e.g. High Canadian Arctic, Antarctic Peninsula), through sub-polar environments (e.g. Baffin Island, Svalbard) to more temperate environments (e.g. SE Alaska). These parameters include: glacier flow velocity, glacier thermal regime, basal debris-rich ice thickness, and marine water temperature. Model results suggest that iceberg sedimentation rates are lowest for high polar settings, and most rapid in warm maritime and some sub-polar areas. However, icebergs in cold waters transport debris to significantly greater distances from the parent glacier. The model provides calculations of order of magnitude rates of iceberg sedimentation in varying glacimarine settings.},

	abstract = {Unlithified sediment at glacier beds should be entrained in ice as a result of melting above individual grains and refreezing below grains (regelation). To test this hypothesis, a device that simulates subglacial conditions was used to push ice downward through idealized and natural porous media in contact with a flat bed. Ice regelated toward the bed at speeds proportional to the gradient in ice pressure across the thickness of particles. Ice temperatures responded predictably to changes in driving stress and demonstrated that the ice-particle mixtures were at or very near the pressure-melting temperature. A theory of pore ice motion by regelation predicted the measured speed usually to within a factor of two, although at low driving stresses the speed was less than the predicted value by as much as a factor of five. The low speeds were probably caused by imperfect temperature control that resulted either in heat loss from the ice-particle mixtures or in slightly subfreezing pore ice temperatures that were not detected by thermistors. Ice should intrude the pores of underlying sediment to a steady depth at which the downward regelation speed equals the rate of basal melting. Departures from the steady state should cause release of debris from ice or further entrainment. An approximate calculation of the steady intrusion depth yields values comparable to typical thicknesses of debris in basal ice, a few centimeters to more than a meter. Intrusion of sediment by regelation is consistent with the isotopic composition of debris-bearing ice, if melting exceeds refreezing.},

Because glaciers concentrate runoff, streams generated by glaciers transport much sediment and may erode bedrock rapidly. Deforming glacier beds also can transport much sediment, particularly in marginal regions. Rapid sediment entrainment producing thick debris-rich basal zones may occur by regelation into subglacial materials, and by freeze-on from rising supercooled waters. Numerous other mechanisms may be important but primarily near ice margins, especially those of advancing or fluctuating glaciers. Several sediment-entrainment mechanisms may be active beneath a single glacier, but one process is likely to be dominant at any place and time.},

The temporal variability in proglacial suspended sediment concentration is analysed using multiple regression techniques in which discharge is supplemented by other predictors acting as surrogates for variability in sediment supply at diurnal, medium-term and seasonal timescales. These multiple regression models improve upon the statistical explanation of suspended sediment concentration produced by simple sediment rating curves but need to account for additional stochastic elements within the time series before they may be considered successful. An interpretation of the physical processes which are responsible for the regression model characteristics is offered as a basis for comparing the different arctic glaciofluvial suspended sediment transport systems with that of their better known temperate glaciofluvial counterparts. It is inferred that the largely warm-based glacier is dominated by sediment supply from subglacial reservoirs which evolve in a similar manner to temperate glaciers and which cause a pronounced seasonal exhaustion of suspended sediment supply. The largely cold-based glacier, however, is dominated by sediment supply from marginal sources which generate a responsive system at short time scales but no significant seasonal pattern. The intermediate polythermal glacier basin, which was anticipated to be similar to the warm-based glacier, instead shows a highly significant seasonal increase in suspended sediment supply from an unusual subglacial reservoir emerging under pressure in the glacier foreland. The temperate model of glaciofluvial suspended sediment transport is therefore found to be of limited use in an arctic context. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This can be explained by the coupling of ice and sediment dynamics: a shoal forms at the glacier terminus, reducing ice discharge and causing advance towards an unstable configuration followed by abrupt retreat, in a process known as the tidewater glacier cycle. Here we use a numerical model calibrated with observations to show that interactions between ice flow, glacial erosion, and sediment transport drive these cycles, which occur independent of climate variations. Water availability controls cycle period and amplitude, and enhanced melt from future warming could trigger advance even in glaciers that are steady or retreating, complicating interpretations of glacier response to climate change. The resulting shifts in sediment and meltwater delivery from changes in glacier configuration may impact interpretations of marine sediments, fjord geochemistry, and marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Proglacial suspended sediment transport was monitored at Haut Glacier d'Arolla, Switzerland, during the 1998 melt season to investigate the mechanisms of basal sediment evacuation by subglacial meltwater. Sub-seasonal changes in relationships between suspended sediment transport and discharge demonstrate that the structure and hydraulics of the subglacial drainage system critically influenced how basal sediment was accessed and entrained. Under hydraulically inefficient subglacial drainage at the start of the melt season, sediment availability was generally high but sediment transport increased relatively slowly with discharge. Later in the melt season, sediment transport increased more rapidly with discharge as subglacial meltwater became confined to a spatially limited network of channels following removal of the seasonal snowpack from the ablation area. Flow capacity is inferred to have increased more rapidly with discharge within subglacial channels because rapid changes in discharge during highly peaked diurnal runoff cycles are likely to have been accommodated largely by changes in flow velocity. Basal sediment availability declined during channelization but increased throughout the remainder of the monitored period, resulting in very efficient basal sediment evacuation over the peak of the melt season. Increased basal sediment availability during the summer appears to have been linked to high diurnal water pressure variation within subglacial channels inferred from the strong increase in flow velocity with discharge. Basal sediment availability therefore appears likely to have been increased by (1) enhanced local ice-bed separation leading to extra-channel flow excursions and[sol ]or (2) the deformation of basal sediment towards low-pressure channels due to a strong diurnally reversing hydraulic gradient between channels and areas of hydraulically less-efficient drainage.

Water remains only partially frozen in a porous medium at temperatures below \$0{\textbackslash},{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$C owing both to the depression of the freezing temperature at curved phase boundaries and to interfacial premelting caused by long-range intermolecular forces. We show that while the former contributes to the geometry of fluid pathways, it is solely the latter effect that generates the forces necessary for frost heave. We develop a simple model describing the formation and evolution of the ice lenses (layers of ice devoid of soil particles) that drive heave, based on integral force balances. We determine conditions under which either (i) a single ice lens propagates with no leading frozen fringe, or (ii) a single, propagating ice lens is separated from unfrozen soil by a partially frozen fringe, or (iii) multiple ice lenses form.},

These layers represent periods of extreme ice discharge, called Heinrich events, and are variously attributed to ice stream flow instability, ice shelf collapse, or enhanced terminus melting due to ocean warming. In this paper, we study the processes controlling how sediment freezes on to the base of ice streams and predict the volume of sediment conveyed by icebergs during a Heinrich event. The local thickness of frozen sediment is sensitive to the heat flux at the ice-bed interface and the water pressure, both of which also contribute to the controls on basal friction; as the basal water pressure increases, both the frozen sediment thickness and the basal friction decrease. The sediment discharged during a Heinrich event must have frozen on to the ice during the inter-Heinrich period. As the Heinrich event proceeds, the frozen sediment melts off the base of the ice stream, indicating that the thickness of sediments deposits in the North Atlantic may not reliably constrain Heinrich event duration. Choosing reasonable parameters corresponding to the Hudson Strait Ice Stream, our model of sediment freeze-on and discharge is consistent with observational estimates of Heinrich event sediment discharge volume.},

	abstract = {The evolution of glaciers and ice sheets depends on processes in the subglacial environment. Shear seismicity along the ice–bed interface provides a window into these processes. Such seismicity requires a rapid loss of strength that is typically ascribed to rate-weakening friction, i.e., decreasing friction with sliding or sliding rate. Many friction experiments have investigated glacial materials at the temperate conditions typical of fast flowing glacier beds. To our knowledge, however, these studies have all found rate-strengthening friction. Here, we investigate the possibility that rate-weakening rock-on-rock friction between sediments frozen to the bottom of the glacier and the underlying water-saturated sediments or bedrock may be responsible for subglacial shear seismicity along temperate glacier beds. We test this ‘entrainment-seismicity hypothesis’ using targeted laboratory experiments and simple models of glacier sliding, seismicity and sediment entrainment. These models suggest that sediment entrainment may be a necessary but not sufficient condition for the occurrence of basal shear seismicity. We propose that stagnation at the Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica may be caused by the growth of a frozen fringe of entrained sediment in the ice stream margins. Our results suggest that basal shear seismicity may indicate geomorphic activity.},

Alternatively, the transition can be more gradual, with ice infiltrating the underlying sediments to form a fringe layer that contains a mixture of ice, liquid water, and sediment particles. The fringe thickness h is predicted to commonly be several decimeters to meters in scale, implying that significant sediment transport can occur when sliding occurs beneath. I adapt theories for the thermodynamic and mechanical balances that control freezing and melting in porous media to determine h as a function of effective stress N, the rate of basal heat flow, and key sediment properties. A fringe is expected only when N {\textgreater} pf ≈ 1.1 (Tm − Tf) MPa/°C, where Tm − Tf is the temperature drop below the pressure-melting point that is needed for ice to infiltrate the pore space; pf increases with decreased grain size. For sediment properties that are within the typical range expected of the tills beneath glaciers, pf = O (104) Pa. The rate that water can be transported through the fringe and frozen onto or melted from the glacier base can achieve a steady state that is in balance with the rate that latent heat is transported to or from the basal interface. At constant N, when a gradual increase in heat flow from the glacier base causes the rate of melting to decrease, h increases and continues to do so when the heat flow is great enough to produce freezing. As freezing becomes more rapid and h increases further, the rate of fluid supply to the glacier base reaches a maximum when the effective permeability is sufficiently reduced by the partial ice saturation in the fringe. Larger h can be achieved with slower freezing at the glacier base, but steady states with larger h are unstable. The maximum rate of fluid supply to the glacier base is greater at lower N, higher temperature gradients, and for sediments with higher permeabilities. Unsteady behavior can lead to large changes in h when there is a mismatch between the rate that latent heat can be extracted and the rate that fluid is supplied to the glacier base. Transient behavior driven by abrupt changes in N is characterized by rapid variations in freezing rate, followed by slower adjustments to h that are limited by the timescale for the conduction of latent heat.

	abstract = {Basal melt rate is the most important physical quantity to be evaluated when looking for an old-ice drilling site, and it depends to a great extent on the geothermal ﬂux (GF), which is poorly known under the East Antarctic ice sheet. Given that wet bedrock has higher reﬂectivity than dry bedrock, the wetness of the ice–bed interface can be assessed using radar echoes from the bedrock. But, since basal conditions depend on heat transfer forced by climate but lagged by the thick ice, the basal ice may currently be frozen whereas in the past it was generally melting. For that reason, the risk of bias between present and past conditions has to be evaluated. The objective of this study is to assess which locations in the Dome C area could have been protected from basal melting at any time in the past, which requires evaluating GF. We used an inverse approach to retrieve GF from radarinferred distribution of wet and dry beds. A 1-D heat model is run over the last 800 ka to constrain the value of GF by assessing a critical ice thickness, i.e. the minimum ice thickness that would allow the present local distribution of basal melting. A regional map of the GF was then inferred over a 80 km × 130 km area, with a N–S gradient and with values ranging from 48 to 60 mW m−2. The forward model was then emulated by a polynomial function to compute a timeaveraged value of the spatially variable basal melt rate over the region. Three main subregions appear to be free of basal melting, two because of a thin overlying ice and one, north of Dome C, because of a low GF.},

Therefore, understanding how the production of sediments by glacial erosion has evolved in the past, and will evolve in a changing climate, is increasingly important. In this Review, we examine the processes that control the magnitude and timing of glacial erosion of mountains, and how models can be used to reconstruct processes during the development of mountains. Field observations reveal the important role of sliding on the erosion rate, which provide an empirical basis to explain the glacial buzzsaw and the impact of late Cenozoic cooling on erosion rates. Glacial erosion is also expected to evolve in the context of anthropogenic climate warming, as both glacier sliding and the input of meltwater related to thinning and retreat of ice will change, with large effects on downstream ecosystems and global biogeochemical cycles. Thus, the mechanics and impacts of glaciers on sediment production warrant more research, especially in regions experiencing rapid warming. Above all, there is a need for better monitoring of how erosion rates changed over the last decades and will evolve in the future.},

	abstract = {Numerical models are used commonly to study the topographic evolution of glacially eroded landscapes. These models are grounded on a power-law rule that relates bedrock erosion rate to either the sliding speed or discharge of glaciers. This rule, however, is poorly linked to the principal process of glacial erosion, quarrying, in which bedrock blocks are dislodged from the bed by sliding ice. A new model of quarrying allows this erosion rule to be evaluated. As in past quarrying models, ice-bed separation during sliding controls deviatoric stresses in the rock that cause crack growth. Unlike past models, bedrock strength heterogeneity resulting from preglacial fractures is included using a Weibull statistical distribution of rock strength. This strength distribution is predicated on the observation that larger rock bodies have lower strengths because they have a greater probability of containing a large fracture. Results can, indeed, be closely fitted with a power-law erosion rule, but its nonlinearity, the range of sliding speed over which it applies, and erosion rates depend sensitively on bedrock strength heterogeneity and effective pressure. This theory anchors large-scale models of glacial erosion to the primary small-scale process that these models hope to simulate and reinforces recent emphasis on the role of bedrock fractures in accelerating geomorphic processes. Moreover, by linking basal water pressure to erosion rate, the theory can improve efforts with numerical models to study feedbacks between subglacial hydrology and landscape evolution.},

	abstract = {Quarrying of bedrock is a primary agent of subglacial erosion. Although the mechanical theory behind the process has been studied for decades, it has proven difficult to formulate the governing principles so that large-scale landscape evolution models can be used to integrate erosion over time. The existing mechanical theory thus stands largely untested in its ability to explain postglacial topography. In this study we relate the physics of quarrying to long-term landscape evolution with a multiscale approach that connects meter-scale cavities to kilometer-scale glacial landscapes. By averaging the quarrying rate across many small-scale bedrock steps, we quantify how regional trends in basal sliding speed, effective pressure, and bed slope affect the rate of erosion. A sensitivity test indicates that a power law formulated in terms of these three variables provides an acceptable basis for quantifying regional-scale rates of quarrying. Our results highlight the strong influence of effective pressure, which intensifies quarrying by increasing the volume of the bed that is stressed by the ice and thereby the probability of rock failure. The resulting pressure dependency points to subglacial hydrology as a primary factor for influencing rates of quarrying and hence for shaping the bedrock topography under warm-based glaciers. When applied in a landscape evolution model, the erosion law for quarrying produces recognizable large-scale glacial landforms: U-shaped valleys, hanging valleys, and overdeepenings. The landforms produced are very similar to those predicted by more standard sliding-based erosion laws, but overall quarrying is more focused in valleys, and less effective at higher elevations.},

In particular, theoretical models for subglacial quarrying and abrasion, as well as hypothesized erosion thresholds associated with subglacial sediment transport, include both positive and negative effects of subglacial water and sediment on the rate of erosion. In order to incorporate the existing theoretical models for subglacial erosion by quarrying and abrasion in a long-term glacial landscape evolution model, we here present a coupled computational framework for simulating the simultaneous flow processes of ice, water, and sediment. We supplement a higher order ice sheet model with simple long-term models for glacial hydrology and subglacial sediment transport, as well as fluvial and hillslope-related erosion processes. An important strength of the modeling framework presented relates to the morphological detail of the landscapes produced, which facilitates direct comparison with existing landforms. This improves the connection between glacial landscape evolution models, geomorphological observations, and the existing knowledge of the physical processes that operate under glaciers. We demonstrate with model examples, how increased basal meltwater pressure and transport-limited subglacial erosion lead to both positive and negative feedbacks related to glacial erosion and the formation of overdeepenings.},

	abstract = {Preliminary results of a quantitative model of glacial abrasion are presented. The analysis, which is constructed within a framework of modern glaciological views of processes near to the bed, is aimed at modeling abrasion under a temperate glacier whose basal layers contain only occasional rock fragments. It does not simulate abrasion by debris-rich ice or by subglacial drift. Calculations of abrasion-rates reduce to evaluations of the forces pressing rock fragments against the glacier bed and of the rates at which they are moved along the bed. The estimated viscous drag induced by ice flow toward the bed due to basal melting is generally the dominant contribution to this contact force. Although the analysis shares several important elements with the pioneering study of Boulton ([c1974]), sufficient fundamental differences in the modeling lead to distinctly different conclusions. Several new results are noteworthy: (1) other parameters being equal, abrasion will tend to be fastest where basal melting is most rapid, (2) glacier thickness does not affect abrasion through its influence on basal pressures, and (3) lodgement of rock fragments is only possible if the sliding velocity is very low, equivalent to the rate of basal melting., RésuméOn présente les résultats préliminaires d’un modèle quantitatif de l’abrasion glaciaire. L’analyse, qui est conduit dans le cadre des perspectives glaciologiques modernes sur les phénomènes au voisinage du lit, a pour but de modéliser l’abrasion sous un glacier tempéré dont les niveaux de base ne contiennent qu’occasionnellement des fragments rocheux. Il ne simule pas l’abrasion par une glace riche en matériaux minéraux ou par l’entrainement sous-glaciaire. Les calculs de vitesses d’abrasion se réduisent à des estimations des forces qui pressent les fragments de rocher contre le lit du glacier et de la vitesse avec laquelle ces fragments sont déplacés le long du lit. L’estimation de la trainée visqueuse provoquée par le courant de glace vers le lit en raison de la fusion à la base constitue en général le facteur dominant à cette force de contact Bien que l’analyse distingue plusieurs éléments importants avec l’étudc pionniére de Boulton ([c1974]), des différences fondamentales suffisantes dans la modélisation conduisent à des conclusions distinctement différentes. Plusieurs résultats nouveaux valent d’être notés: (1) à égalité des autres paramètres, l’abrasion tendra à être la plus rapide lorsque la fusion à la base sera la plus active, (2) l’épaisseur du glacier n’affecte pas l’abrasion par l’intermédiaire de son influence sur les pressions à la base, et (3) le dépôt d’un fragment de roche n’est possible qui si la vitesse de glissement est très faible, èquivalente à la vitesse de la fusion à la base., ZusammenfassungEs werden vorläufige Ergebnisse eines quantitativen Modells der glazialen Abrasion vorgelegt. Die Analyse, die sich im Rahmen moderner glaziologischer Ansichten über die Vorgänge nahe am Untergrund hält, zielt auf die Modellierung der Abrasion unter einem temperierten Gletscher, dessen unterste Schichten nur gelegentlich Felsstücke enthalten; es simuliert nicht die Abrasion durch schuttreiches Eis oder subglazialen Schutt. Berechnungen von Abrasionsraten beschränken sich auf die Auswertung der Kräfte, die Felspartikel gegen das Felsbett anpressen, und der Geschwindigkeit, mit denen sie über das Bett bewegt werden. Die geschätzte viskose Schleppkraft, hervorgerufen durch den Eisfluss gegen das Bett infolge von Schmelzvorgängen am Untergrund, ist im allgemeinen der wichtigste Beitrag zu dieser Kontaktkraft. Obwohl dieses Modell einige wichtige Elemente mit der grundlegenden Studie von Boulton ([c1974]) gemeinsam hat, führen wesentliche Unter-schiede im Modellaufbau zu erheblich verschiedenen Folgerungen. Einige neue Ergebnisse erscheinen bemerkenswert: (1) Bleiben andere Parameter unverändert, so erreicht die Abrasion ihre Höchstwerte dort, wo das Schmelzen am Untergrund am schnellsten vor sich geht; (2) Die Gletscherdicke wirkt sich auf die Abrasion trotz ihres Einflusses auf den Druck am Untergrund nicht aus; (3) Die Anhäufung von Felsstücken ist nur möglich, wenn die Gleitgeschwindigkeit sehr niedrig ist, entsprechend der Geschwindigkeit des Schmelzens am Untergrund.},

	abstract = {Glaciers are highly effective agents of erosion that have profoundly shaped Earth’s surface, but there is uncertainty about how glacial erosion should be parameterised in landscape evolution models. Glacial erosion rate is usually modelled as a function of glacier sliding velocity, but the empirical basis for this relationship is weak. In turn, climate is assumed to control sliding velocity and hence erosion, but this too lacks empirical scrutiny. Here, we present statistically robust relationships between erosion rates, sliding velocities, and climate from a global compilation of 38 glaciers. We show that sliding is positively and significantly correlated with erosion, and derive a relationship for use in erosion models. Our dataset further demonstrates that the most rapid erosion is achieved at temperate glaciers with high mean annual precipitation, which serve to promote rapid sliding. Precipitation has received little attention in glacial erosion studies, but our data illustrate its importance.},

	abstract = {Ice-infiltrated sediment, known as a frozen fringe, leads to phenomena such as frost heave, ice lenses, and meters of debris-rich ice under glaciers. Understanding the dynamics of frozen fringe development is important as frost heave is responsible for damaging infrastructure at high latitudes and frozen sediments at the base of glaciers can modulate glacier flow, influencing the rate of global sea level rise. Here we study the fluid physics of interstitial freezing water in sediments and focus on the conditions relevant for subglacial environments. We describe the thermomechanics of liquid water flow through and freezing in ice-saturated frozen sediments. The force balance that governs the frozen fringe thickness depends on the weight of the overlying material, the thermomolecular force between ice and sediments across premelted films of liquid, and the water pressure within liquid films that is required by flow according to Darcy's law. We combine this mechanical model with an enthalpy method which conserves energy across phase change interfaces on a fixed computational grid. The force balance and enthalpy model together determine the evolution of the frozen fringe thickness and our simulations predict frost heave rates and ice lens spacing. Our model accounts for premelting at ice-sediment contacts, partial ice saturation of the pore space, water flow through the fringe, the thermodynamics of the ice-water-sediment interface, and vertical force balance. We explicitly account for the formation of ice lenses, regions of pure ice that cleave the fringe at the depth where the interparticle force vanishes. Our model results allow us to predict the thickness of a frozen fringe and the spacing of ice lenses at the base of glaciers.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The basal thermal state (frozen or thawed) of the Greenland Ice
Sheet is under-constrained due to few direct measurements, yet knowledge of
this state is becoming increasingly important to interpret modern changes in
ice flow. The first synthesis of this state relied on inferences from
widespread airborne and satellite observations and numerical models, for
which most of the underlying datasets have since been updated. Further, new
and independent constraints on the basal thermal state have been developed
from analysis of basal and englacial reflections observed by airborne radar
sounding. Here we synthesize constraints on the Greenland Ice Sheet's basal
thermal state from boreholes, thermomechanical ice-flow models that
participated in the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6
(ISMIP6; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6), IceBridge BedMachine Greenland v4 bed topography, Making Earth Science Data Records
for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) Multi-Year Greenland Ice Sheet Velocity
Mosaic v1 and multiple inferences of a thawed bed from airborne radar
sounding. Most constraints can only identify where the bed is likely thawed
rather than where it is frozen. This revised synthesis of the Greenland
likely Basal Thermal State version 2 (GBaTSv2) indicates that 33 \% of the
ice sheet's bed is likely thawed, 40 \% is likely frozen and the remainder
(28 \%) is too uncertain to specify. The spatial pattern of GBaTSv2 is
broadly similar to the previous synthesis, including a scalloped frozen core
and thawed outlet-glacier systems. Although the likely basal thermal state
of nearly half (46 \%) of the ice sheet changed designation, the assigned
state changed from likely frozen to likely thawed (or vice versa) for less
than 6 \% of the ice sheet. This revised synthesis suggests that more of
northern Greenland is likely thawed at its bed and conversely that more of
southern Greenland is likely frozen, both of which influence interpretation
of the ice sheet's present subglacial hydrology and models of its future
evolution. The GBaTSv2 dataset, including both code that performed the
analysis and the resulting datasets, is freely available at

Here, we present the first estimate of the total and regional basal melt produced by the ice sheet and the recent change in basal melt through time. We find that the ice sheet’s present basal melt production is 21.4 +4.4/−4.0 Gt per year, and that melt generated by basal friction is responsible for about half of this volume. We estimate that basal melting has increased by 2.9 ± 5.2 Gt during the first decade of the 2000s. As the Arctic warms, we anticipate that basal melt will continue to increase due to faster ice flow and more surface melting thus compounding current mass loss trends, enhancing solid ice discharge, and modifying fjord circulation.},

	abstract = {Englacial temperature measurements in Arctic valley glaciers suggest in the ablation zone the existence of a basal layer of temperate ice lying below the bulk of cold ice. For such a polythermal glacier, a mathematical model is presented that calculates the temperature in the cold part and the position of the cold-temperate transition surface (CTS). The model is based on the continuum hypothesis for ice and the ice-water mixture, and on the conservation laws for moisture and energy. Temperate ice is treated as a binary mixture of ice and water at the melting point of pure ice. Boundary and transition conditions are formulated for the free surface, the base and the intraglacial cold-temperate transition surface. The model is reduced to two dimensions (plane flow) and the shallow-ice approximation is invoked. The limit of very small moisture diffusivity is analysed by using a stationary model with further reduction to one dimension (parallel-sided slab), thus providing the means of a consistent formulation of the transition conditions for moisture and heat flux through the CTS at the limit of negligibly small moisture diffusion.The application of the model to the steady-state Laika Glacier, using present-day conditions, results in a wholly cold glacier with a cold sole, in sharp contrast to observations. The present polythermal state of this glacier is suspected to be a remnant of the varying climatic conditions and glacier geometry during the past few centuries. Steady-state solutions representing a polythermal structure can indeed be found within a range of prescribed conditions which are judged to be realistic for Laika Glacier at the last maximum extent of the glacier.},

The enthalpy method alone does not include explicitly the transition conditions at the cold–temperate transition surface (CTS) that separates the upper cold from the lower temperate layer. However, these conditions are important for correctly determining the position of the CTS. For the numerical solution of the polythermal slab problem, we consider a two-layer front-tracking scheme as well as three different one-layer schemes (conventional one-layer scheme, one-layer melting CTS scheme, one-layer freezing CTS scheme). Computed steady-state temperature and water-content profiles are verified with exact solutions, and transient solutions computed by the one-layer schemes are compared with those of the two-layer scheme, considered to be a reliable reference. While the conventional one-layer scheme (that does not include the transition conditions at the CTS) can produce correct solutions for melting conditions at the CTS, it is more reliable to enforce the transition conditions explicitly. For freezing conditions, it is imperative to enforce them because the conventional one-layer scheme cannot handle the associated discontinuities.

Temperature and liquid water fraction are, however, functions of a single enthalpy variable: a small enthalpy change in cold ice is a change in temperature, while a small enthalpy change in temperate ice is a change in liquid water fraction. The unified enthalpy formulation described here models the mass and energy balance for the threedimensional ice fluid, for the surface runoff layer and for the subglacial hydrology layer, together in a single energy-conserving theoretical framework. It is implemented in the Parallel Ice Sheet Model. Results for the Greenland ice sheet are compared with those from a cold-ice scheme.

The models self-consistently predict the evolution of temperature in cold ice and of water content in temperate ice.

	abstract = {The steady motion of a wire or other object through a block of ice by regelation is analysed theoretically. The solutions of the heat flow problem and the associated water flow problem are not independent, in general, because they both involve the thickness of the water film surrounding the moving object. Where the controlling thermal resistance is that of the object, however, the velocity under a given force may be calculated independently of the water film thickness. In this case the velocity of an object of given thermal resistivity, under a given force, depends only on its volume and not on its shape; the velocity is thus independent of the attitude of the object. For a sphere or a circular cylindrical wire the thickness of the water film is always uniform and is independent of the velocity of the object, regardless of whether the controlling thermal resistance is that of the object, the water film or the ice. Some of the theoretical expectations are in conflict with recent experiments and possible explanations are suggested. The mere fact that the object moves at all by regelation seems to contradict the Verhoogen theory of pressure melting under non-hydrostatic stress. In a supplementary note to the paper Professor F. C. Frank argues that the geometry of the water film described is usually unstable, and that this may explain the experimental results.},

When the temperature is sufﬁciently close to that of bulk transition, the surface melts and literally ﬂows as a viscous ﬂuid. This phenomenon, called interfacial premelting, lies at the heart of the microscopic theory of melting of solid matter, and captures the interest of condensed matter physicists and physical chemists alike. The process is ubiquitous and responsible for a wide range of consequences in materials with biological, geophysical, and technological signiﬁcance. Because such systems are often exposed to spatial or temporal variations in thermodynamic forcing, there are a host of ﬂuid mechanical phenomena that result from this underlying melting behavior. The ﬂuid dynamics of unfrozen surfaces holds clues for understanding the bulk behavior of polycrystalline materials, from Earth’s mantle to the stratosphere and beyond. In this review we focus on the ﬂuid dynamical consequences of the premelting of solids.},

The critical velocity is less sensitive to the temperature gradient and the precise dependence changes with different interaction types. When the critical velocity is exceeded, the particle becomes trapped within the solid region after being pushed slightly ahead of its initial position. The predicted particle displacement is typically only a fraction of the particle radius. Particle buoyancy can enhance or reduce the tendency for the particle to be captured, though it does not affect the parametric dependence of the critical velocity on the particle radius and the temperature gradient.},

	abstract = {Mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) has increased over the last two decades in response to changes in global climate, motivating the scientific community to question how the GrIS will contribute to sea-level rise on timescales that are relevant to coastal communities. Observations also indicate that the impact of a melting GrIS extends beyond sea-level rise, including changes to ocean properties and circulation, nutrient and sediment cycling, and ecosystem function. Unfortunately, despite the rapid growth of interest in GrIS mass loss and its impacts, we still lack the ability to confidently predict the rate of future mass loss and the full impacts of this mass loss on the globe. Uncertainty in GrIS mass loss projections in part stems from the nonlinear response of the ice sheet to climate forcing, with many processes at play that influence how mass is lost. This is particularly true for outlet glaciers in Greenland that terminate in the ocean because their flow is strongly controlled by multiple processes that alter their boundary conditions at the ice-atmosphere, ice-ocean, and ice-bed interfaces. Many of these processes change on a range of overlapping timescales and are challenging to observe, making them difficult to understand and thus missing in prognostic ice sheet/climate models. For example, recent (beginning in the late 1990s) mass loss via outlet glaciers has been attributed primarily to changing ice-ocean interactions, driven by both oceanic and atmospheric warming, but the exact mechanisms controlling the onset of glacier retreat and the processes that regulate the amount of retreat remain uncertain. Here we review the progress in understanding GrIS outlet glacier sensitivity to climate change, how mass loss has changed over time, and how our understanding has evolved as observational capacity expanded. Although many processes are far better understood than they were even a decade ago, fundamental gaps in our understanding of certain processes remain. These gaps impede our ability to understand past changes in dynamics and to make more accurate mass loss projections under future climate change. As such, there is a pressing need for (1) improved, long-term observations at the ice-ocean and ice-bed boundaries, (2) more observationally constrained numerical ice flow models that are coupled to atmosphere and ocean models, and (3) continued development of a collaborative and interdisciplinary scientific community.},

Here we calibrate satellite imagery to estimate suspended sediment concentration for 160 proglacial rivers across Greenland. Combining these suspended sediment reconstructions with numerical calculations of meltwater runoff, we quantify the amount and spatial pattern of sediment export from the ice sheet. We find that, although runoff from Greenland represents only 1.1\% of the Earth’s freshwater flux, the Greenland ice sheet produces approximately 8\% of the modern fluvial export of suspended sediment to the global ocean. Sediment loads are highly variable between rivers, consistent with observed differences in ice dynamics and thus with control by glacial erosion. Rivers that originate from deeply incised, fast-moving glacial tongues form distinct sediment-export hotspots: just 15\% of Greenland’s rivers transport 80\% of the total sediment load of the ice sheet. We conclude that future acceleration of melt and ice sheet flow may increase sediment delivery from Greenland to its fjords and the nearby ocean.},

Buoyant sediment plumes that develop in fjords downstream of outlet glaciers are controlled by numerous factors, including meltwater runoff. Here, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery is used to average surface suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in fjords around \&sim;80\% of Greenland from 2000–2009. Spatial and temporal patterns in SSC are compared with positive-degree-days (PDD), a proxy for surface melting, from the Polar MM5 regional climate model. Over this decade significant geographic covariance occurred between ice sheet PDD and fjord SSC, with outlet type (land- vs. marine-terminating glaciers) also important. In general, high SSC is associated with high PDD and/or a high proportion of land-terminating glaciers. Unlike previous site-specific studies of the Watson River plume at Kangerlussuaq, temporal covariance is low, suggesting that plume dimensions best capture interannual runoff dynamics whereas SSC allows assessment of meltwater signals across much broader fjord environments around the ice sheet. Remote sensing of both plume characteristics thus offers a viable approach for observing spatial and temporal patterns of meltwater release from the Greenland ice sheet to the global ocean.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The path of the icebergs, clearly marked by the presence of ice-rafted detrital carbonate, can be traced for more than 3,000 km—a remarkable distance, attesting to extreme cooling of surface waters and enormous amounts of drifting ice. The cause of these extreme events is puzzling. They may reflect repeated rapid advances of the Laurentide ice sheet, perhaps associated with reductions in air temperatures, yet temperature records from Greenland ice cores appear to exhibit only a weak corresponding signal. Moreover, the 5–10,000-yr intervals between the events are inconsistent with Milankovitch orbital periodicities, raising the question of what the ultimate cause of the postulated cooling may have been.},

The size of the Ross Sea polynya from 1992 to 2001 was related to the climate state as expressed by the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI). These data show that 76\% of the variation in sea-ice extent between 1992 and 2000 can be explained by the MEI, with the El Niño year of 1997–1998 exhibiting the greatest sea-ice cover and the La Niña year of 1999–2000 the least. Whether the relationship between ice area and the MEI is caused by interannual changes in wind patterns or changes in the movement of circumpolar deep water onto the Ross Sea continental shelf has yet to be determined. The year 2000–2001 was excluded from the climate analysis, due to the effects of the enormous B-15 iceberg, which inhibited the normal advection pattern of sea-ice out of the Ross Sea, resulting in higher than normal sea-ice conditions. Phytoplankton blooms were markedly less extensive in the heavy sea-ice years of 1997–1998 and 2000–2001 and were significantly delayed in their development, with concentrations of Chl a peaking 2 months later (February) than in reduced sea-ice years (December). Annual production during the 1997–1998 El Niño (27.4TgC) was similar to that of the iceberg impacted year 2000–2001 (28.3TgC). These annual rates were approximately 40\% below values estimated between November 1998 and March 2000 (47.5TgC) when open-water area during spring and summer was much greater. This decreased production during heavy sea-ice years is more a function of the delay in the start of the bloom than in the reduction of open water area.},

Amorphous silica comprises {\textgreater}95\% of this flux and is highly soluble in sea water, as indicated by a significant increase in dissolved silica across a fjord salinity gradient. Retreating palaeo ice sheets were therefore likely responsible for high dissolved and amorphous silica fluxes into the ocean during the last deglaciation, reaching values of ∼5.5 Tmol year−1, similar to the estimated export from palaeo rivers.

Glacial sediment sources of iron have rarely been considered, as the iron has been assumed to be inert and non-bioavailable. This study demonstrates the presence of potentially bioavailable Fe as ferrihydrite and goethite in nanoparticulate clusters, in sediments collected from icebergs in the Southern Ocean and glaciers on the Antarctic landmass. Nanoparticles in ice can be transported by icebergs away from coastal regions in the Southern Ocean, enabling melting to release bioavailable Fe to the open ocean. The abundance of nanoparticulate iron has been measured by an ascorbate extraction. This data indicates that the fluxes of bioavailable iron supplied to the Southern Ocean from aeolian dust (0.01–0.13 Tg yr-1) and icebergs (0.06–0.12 Tg yr-1) are comparable. Increases in iceberg production thus have the capacity to increase productivity and this newly identified negative feedback may help to mitigate fossil fuel emissions.},

He estimated that these layers are spaced at intervals of roughly 10 000 years. In this paper we present detailed information documenting the existence of the upper five of these layers in ODP core 609 from 50° N and 24° W. Their ages are respectively 15 000 radiocarbon years, 20 000 radiocarbon years, 27 000 radiocarbon years, about 40 000 years, and about 50 000 years. We also note that the high lithic fragment to foram ratio is the result of a near absence of shells in these layers. Although we are not of one mind regarding the origin of these layers, we lean toward an explanation that the Heinrich layers are debris released during the melting of massive influxes of icebergs into the northern Atlantic. These sudden inputs may be the result of surges along the eastern margin of the Laurentide ice sheet.},

	abstract = {Heinrich events, the massive episodic disgorgement of sediment-laden ice from the Laurentide Ice Sheet to the North Atlantic Ocean, are a puzzling instability of the Ice-Age climate system. Although there is broad agreement on the defining characteristics of Heinrich events, the glaciological mechanisms remain controversial. Paleoceanographic records show that Heinrich events tend to occur at the culmination of a cooling cycle, termed the Bond cycle, and this has invited the interpretation that the events are a fast response of the Laurentide Ice Sheet to external atmospheric changes. A vexing issue for glaciologists is how a fast and timely response to an external forcing can possibly be reconciled with the known physics of glaciers and ice sheets. Fast changes in glacier behavior can only occur if some flow instability is excited. Thus glaciologists tend to favor the idea that the climate change occurring at the culmination of a Bond cycle is an atmospheric response to ice sheet instability. However, a free-running cyclic flow instability, such as that exhibited by surging glaciers, could not satisfy the timing requirements. Using computer modeling we explore ways to resolve these conflicts.},

We investigate a simple conceptual model of ice stream instability (the binge/purge model) to suggest ways in which the ice stream could have entrained sufficient debris to account for the estimated mass of IRD associated with a typical Heinrich IRD layer in the North Atlantic (1.0 ± 0.3 × 1015 kg). We find that freezing of debris-laden ice at the bed of the ice stream during the brief (≈ 750 years) surge phase of the ice stream's hypothesized binge/purge cycle can incorporate up to 5.1 × 1015 kg. This amount is sufficient to meet the constraints of the North Atlantic sediment record but by no means verifies the binge/purge model as the cause of Heinrich events.},

However, the resulting facies descriptions and names are inconsistent and no single scheme encompasses all of the different ice types that exist at different ice masses. In this paper, we review and critique existing basal ice facies names, descriptions and classification schemes, and propose a new, non-genetic approach that has the capacity to name and describe all basal ice types. We define six fundamental basal cryofacies and a further 12 composite cryofacies which can all be defined on the basis of a cursory evaluation of debris disposition and concentration. More detailed cryofacies description is based on characterizing three sets of ice properties that can also be estimated visually in the field: (a) the thickness of the basal ice facies and its constituent sub-layers, (b) the concentration and texture of debris included within any or all of those layers, and (c) the concentration and size of bubbles included within any or all of those layers. We also propose a shorthand method for the presentation of this descriptive information. Here, codes for the layer thicknesses are presented as standard text, and codes for the included debris characteristics and included bubble characteristics are presented as superscripts and subscripts respectively. Sub-layers are characterized similarly, but within a nested sequence of brackets. We evaluate the effectiveness of these two schemes by using them to rename and reclassify several existing basal ice facies. Results indicate that the schemes are robust and that they provide a coherent, non-genetic framework for the effective naming and description of basal cryofacies.},

The origin of dispersed facies is poorly understood, with several hypotheses having been advanced for its formation, and there is disagreement as to whether it is largely a sedimentary or a tectonic feature. We test these established hypotheses at the temperate glacier Svínafellsjökull, Iceland, and find that none fully account for dispersed facies characteristics at this location. Instead, dispersed facies physical, sedimentological and stable-isotope (δ18O, δD) characteristics favour a predominantly tectonic origin that we suggest comprises the regelation and strain-induced metamorphism of debris-rich basal ice that has been entrained into an englacial position by tectonic processes operating at the base of an icefall. Further thickening of the resultant dispersed facies may also occur tectonically as a result of ice flow against the reverse bed slope of a terminal overdeepening. Lack of efficient subglacial drainage in the region of the overdeepening may limit basal melting and thus favour basal ice preservation, including the preservation of dispersed facies. Despite the relatively low sediment content of dispersed facies ( ∼1.6\% by volume), its thickness (up to 25 m) and ubiquity at Svínafellsjökull results in a significant contribution to annual sediment discharge (1635–3270 m3 a−1) that is ∼6.5 times that contributed by debris-rich stratified facies basal ice.},

Melt-out till ranges from structureless to stratified with interspersed lenses and discontinuous laminae, and generally possesses a well-defined pebble fabric. Sediment flow deposits show various combinations of six sedimentologic units with distinct sedimentary features and clast dispersion. Pebble fabric is absent or poorly defined, depending upon the unit's origin.

The BIL is chemically and physically distinctive, and is characterised by a component of basally derived sediment. The BIL is: a rheological control on ice-sheet dynamics; an indicator of subglacial conditions and processes; an agent of subglacial geologic processes; the source of a substantial proportion of glacial sediments; a limit to the downward extension of the climate record from deep ice cores. If debris characteristics of the BIL are preserved in glacial sediments, former glacier conditions can be inferred. Analysis of stable isotopes, gas and cation composition, ice crystallography, debris composition and structural glaciology has elucidated many mechanisms for BIL formation. Common elements can be identified from a range of locations. Key issues are entrainment of ice and debris from the bed, formation of new ice, metamorphism of existing ice in the BIL, and thickening of the BIL by deformation. A distinction can be made between basal ice formed by accretion of material from the bed (‘stratified facies’) and basal ice formed by metamorphic processes within the ice close to the bed (‘dispersed facies’).},

	abstract = {Glaciers erode their beds and the adjacent landscape by abrasion and plucking and entraining sediment on their way downwards driven by gravity. Ice becomes a sediment transport agent. To determine glacial transport of sediment, measurements of both the ice flux and its concentration of sediment are needed. Once glaciers reach the ocean, ice and its entrained sediment is released into the ocean by calving. Further transport takes place by icebergs. Quantification of IRD (ice-rafted debris) fluxes, which upon ultimate deposition on the ocean floor is an important climate indicator, becomes even more complicated as icebergs topple and differentially melt while being in transport. While the volume of tidewater glacier ice released by recent calving is quite well constrained by satellite measurements, there is a lack of measurements of the concentration of sediment within the moving ice. Here, we describe a method to collect samples of ice from icebergs systematically for the first time in Greenland together with a strategy to obtain representative samples. Our method is tested in Scoresby Sound, East Greenland in order to describe the transport of sediment into the fjord system related to calving from known glacial source areas. Our data clearly demonstrate that biased and sparse sampling potentially produces unrealistic values of sediment concentrations. Seventy-two samples from 24 icebergs had an average concentration of sediment of 35.5 g/L of ice with a standard deviation of 97\%, between the 24 individual icebergs. The origin of the sediment is related to specific source areas. Based on the samples, we present an estimate of the annual transport of sediment out of Scoresby Sound related to calving 100 (0.3–200) million t year−1. Finally, we discuss the uncertainties of our estimate.},

The enhanced sediment discharge persists through peak water discharge and despite annual bedrock erosion volume decreasing by approximately 30\% from the initial value. The greater sediment discharge results from increased melt at the glaciers' higher region, where transport was limited prior to glacier retreat. These findings suggest that large increases in sediment discharge may occur as glaciers retreat.

The icepack package is built on the finite element modeling library Firedrake, which uses the Unified Form Language (UFL), a domain-specific language embedded into Python for describing weak forms of partial differential equations. The diagnostic models in icepack are formulated through action principles that are specified in UFL. The components of each action functional can be substituted for different forms of the user's choosing, which makes it easy to experiment with the model physics. The action functional itself can be used to define a solver convergence criterion that is independent of the mesh and requires little tuning on the part of the user. The icepack package includes the 2D shallow ice and shallow stream models. We have also defined a 3D hybrid model based on spectral semi-discretization of the Blatter–Pattyn equations. Finally, icepack includes a Gauss–Newton solver for inverse problems that runs substantially faster than the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) method often used in the glaciological literature. The overall design philosophy of icepack is to be as usable as possible for a wide a swath of the glaciological community, including both experts and novices in computational science.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The four RCPs together span the range of year 2100 radiative forcing values found in the open literature, i.e. from 2.6 to 8.5 W/m2. The RCPs are the product of an innovative collaboration between integrated assessment modelers, climate modelers, terrestrial ecosystem modelers and emission inventory experts. The resulting product forms a comprehensive data set with high spatial and sectoral resolutions for the period extending to 2100. Land use and emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases are reported mostly at a 0.5 × 0.5 degree spatial resolution, with air pollutants also provided per sector (for well-mixed gases, a coarser resolution is used). The underlying integrated assessment model outputs for land use, atmospheric emissions and concentration data were harmonized across models and scenarios to ensure consistency with historical observations while preserving individual scenario trends. For most variables, the RCPs cover a wide range of the existing literature. The RCPs are supplemented with extensions (Extended Concentration Pathways, ECPs), which allow climate modeling experiments through the year 2300. The RCPs are an important development in climate research and provide a potential foundation for further research and assessment, including emissions mitigation and impact analysis.},

Here we demonstrate that detailed analysis of seismic ground motion caused by subglacial water flow at Mendenhall Glacier (Alaska) allows for continuous measurement of daily to subseasonal changes in basal water pressure gradient, channel size, and sediment transport. We observe intermittent subglacial water pressure gradient changes during the melt season, at odds with common assumptions of slowly varying, low-pressure channels. These observations indicate that changes in channel size do not keep pace with changes in discharge. This behavior strongly affects glacier dynamics and subglacial channel erosion at Mendenhall Glacier, where episodic periods of high water pressure gradients enhance glacier surface velocity and channel sediment transport by up to 30\% and 50\%, respectively. We expect the application of this framework to future seismic observations acquired at glaciers worldwide to improve our understanding of subglacial processes.},

	abstract = {Glacier ecosystems are a significant source of bioavailable, yet ancient dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Characterizing DOC in Mendenhall Glacier outflow (southeast Alaska) we document a seasonal persistence to the radiocarbon-depleted signature of DOC, highlighting ancient DOC as a ubiquitous feature of glacier outflow. We observed no systematic depletion in Δ 14C-DOC with increasing discharge during the melt season that would suggest mobilization of an aged subglacial carbon store. However, DOC concentration, δ 13C-DOC, Δ 14C-DOC and fluorescence signatures appear to have been influenced by runoff from vegetated hillslopes above the glacier during onset and senescence of melt. In the peak glacier melt period, the Δ 14C-DOC of stream samples at the outflow (−181.7 to −355.3‰) was comparable to the Δ 14C-DOC for snow samples from the accumulation zone (−207.2 to −390.9‰), suggesting that ancient DOC from the glacier surface is exported in glacier runoff. The pre-aged DOC in glacier snow and runoff is consistent with contributions from fossil fuel combustion sources similar to those documented previously in ice cores and thus provides evidence for anthropogenic perturbation of the carbon cycle. Overall, our results emphasize the need to further characterize DOC inputs to glacier ecosystems, particularly in light of predicted changes in glacier mass and runoff in the coming century.},

Glaciers drive water and sediment export from many high-elevation and high-latitude ecosystems, yet their role in watershed OC balances is poorly understood, particularly with regard to particulate OC. Here, we evaluate seasonal water, sediment, and comprehensive OC budgets, including both dissolved and particulate forms, for three watersheds in southeast Alaska that vary in glacier coverage. We show that glacier loss will shift the dominant size fraction of riverine OC from particulate toward dissolved and potentially alter the provenance of particulate OC. Glacier coverage also controls whether OC export is source (C stock) or transport (runoff) limited at the watershed scale. These findings provide insight into the future trajectory of riverine OC export in glacierized regions.},

Long-term mass wastage linked to climatic trends is responsible for thinning of the lower glacier and leaving the terminus vulnerable to buoyancy-driven calving and accelerated retreat. Bedrock topography has played a major role in stabilizing the terminus between periods of rapid calving and retreat. Lake-terminating glaciers form a population distinct from both tidewater glaciers and polar ice tongues, with some similarities to both groups. Lacustrine termini experience fewer perturbations (e.g. tidal flexure, high subaqueous melt rates) and are therefore inherently more stable than tidewater termini. At Mendenhall, rapid thinning and simultaneous retreat into a deeper basin led to flotation conditions along approximately 50\% of the calving front. This unstable terminus geometry lasted for approximately 2 years and culminated in largescale calving and terminus collapse during summer 2004. Buoyancy-driven calving events and terminus break-up can result from small, rapidly applied perturbations in lake level.},

Coatings 0.5{\textasciicircum}20 mm thick occur in two distinct morphologies. Thin, striated siltskins coat mainly stoss faces. Thicker, corrugated siltskins on lee faces consist of parallel micro-ridges elongated downslope. Thin-section analysis shows that siltskins consist of a basal, calcite-rich layer overlain by microlaminated layers of calcite-cemented lithic grains. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analysis of laminae and surfaces shows laterally persistent Ca/Si differences. Isotopic values for  O18 and  O13 ranged from {\textasciicircum}19.52ø to {\textasciicircum}12.74ø and {\textasciicircum}6.18ø to {\textasciicircum}3.44ø, respectively, consistent with deposition from subglacial waters of varying isotopic composition and with derivation of carbon from inorganic sources. Corrugated siltskins are complex depositional features modified by erosional processes. Parallel micro-ridges spaced 1{\textasciicircum} 10 mm apparently formed as sediment-rich water dripped down lee-slope rock faces. Ice{\textasciicircum} rock separation, flow energy and the transported sediment controlled the layering and depositional forms. Siltskins probably formed when a subglacial cavity system was active on the rock ridge and provide clues about how microscale hydrologic processes interact with larger-scale subglacial systems.},

Predicting ice flow and erosion therefore requires knowledge of subglacial channel evolution, which remains observationally limited. Here we demonstrate that detailed analysis of seismic ground motion caused by subglacial water flow at Mendenhall Glacier (Alaska) allows for continuous measurement of daily to subseasonal changes in basal water pressure gradient, channel size, and sediment transport. We observe intermittent subglacial water pressure gradient changes during the melt season, at odds with common assumptions of slowly varying, low-pressure channels. These observations indicate that changes in channel size do not keep pace with changes in discharge. This behavior strongly affects glacier dynamics and subglacial channel erosion at Mendenhall Glacier, where episodic periods of high water pressure gradients enhance glacier surface velocity and channel sediment transport by up to 30\% and 50\%, respectively. We expect the application of this framework to future seismic observations acquired at glaciers worldwide to improve our understanding of subglacial processes.},

	abstract = {Glaciers erode bedrock but are also efficient conveyors of debris supplied during a cycle of glaciation by processes other than basal erosion. In this dual capacity as both an eroding and a transporting agent lies the ambiguity of ‘glacial erosion’ as a geomorphic process, with implications for methods of measuring the removal of rock mass by glaciers in the geological past, and for interpreting what exactly the consequences have been on topography and elevation change. A global review of ∼400 Quaternary glacial denudation rates estimated from five different measurement techniques provides values ranging between 10−4 and 10mmyr−1. We investigate the causes of such wide variability by examining the respective influences of environmental setting and methodological bias. A reference frame chosen for assessing these issues is the Massif du Carlit (Pyrenees, France), where a quantified mass balance of the well preserved glacial, periglacial and paraglacial deposits was made possible by detailed geomorphological mapping and terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide dating of extant erosional and depositional landform sequences. Resulting age brackets helped to define three main episodes of ice-cap growth and decline, each characterized by a volume of debris and a mappable source area. Erosion rates were expressed in two ways: (i) as spatially averaged denudation rates (D) during the successive stages of glacial advance to the line of maximum ice extent (MIE), post-MIE ice recession, and Lateglacial cirque readvance, respectively; and (ii) as cirque-wall recession rates (R) where moraine facies criteria indicated a supraglacial provenance of debris. Results indicate low erosion (D≈0.05mmyr−1) during the ice advance phase, probably because of thin or passive ice covering the low-gradient subglacial topography that occurs just above the late Pleistocene equilibrium line altitude (2.2–2.4km). Erosion rates peaked (D≈0.6mmyr−1 and R≈2.4–4.5mmyr−1) during the main transition to ice-free conditions, when deglacial debuttressing promoted the rapid response of freshly exposed slope systems to new equilibrium conditions in the steep crest zone. Lateglacial D- and R-values declined to 0.2–0.3mmyr−1, with indications of spatially variable R controlled by lithology. In this environment glaciers overall behaved more as conveyors of debris supplied by supraglacial rock exposures in the mountain crest zone than as powerful modifiers of subglacial topography. This explains the widespread preservation of deep, in situ preglacial weathering profiles on relict Cenozoic land surfaces in the deglacierized part of the Eastern Pyrenees. When plotted on the global data set analyzed and discussed in the review, the East Pyrenean erosion rates stand out as being amongst the lowest on record.},

	abstract = {Glacier-erosion rates range across orders of magnitude, and much of this variation cannot be attributed to basal sliding rates. Subglacial till acts as lubricating ‘fault gouge’ or ‘sawdust’, and must be removed for rapid subglacial bedrock erosion. Such erosion occurs especially where and when moulin-fed streams access the bed and are unconstrained by supercooling or other processes. Streams also may directly erode bedrock, likely with strong time-evolution. Erosion is primarily by quarrying, aided by strong fluctuations in the water system driven by variable surface melt and by subglacial earthquakes. Debris-bed friction significantly affects abrasion, quarrying and general glacier flow. Frost heave drives cirque headwall erosion as winter cold air enters bergschrunds, creating temperature gradients to drive water flow along premelted films to growing ice lenses that fracture rock, and the glacier removes the resulting blocks. Recent subglacial bedrock erosion and sediment flux are in many cases much higher than long-term averages. Over glacial cycles, evolution of glacial-valley form feeds back strongly on erosion and deposition. Most of this is poorly quantified, with parts open to argument. Glacial erosion and interactions are important to tectonic and volcanic processes as well as climate and biogeochemical fluxes, motivating vigorous research.},

Rapid sediment entrainment producing thick debris-rich basal zones may occur by regelation into subglacial materials, and by freeze-on from rising supercooled waters.

	abstract = {Glacial erosion is known to be driven by sliding, which occurs in brief episodes in the melt season. What is not known is how well this sliding history is reflected in the sediment output from a glacier and to what degree temporary sediment storage in the glacier smoothes the history of sediment production. We document sediment evacuation rates for three seasons at Bench Glacier, a small temperate alpine glacier in the Chugach Range of Alaska. Two lines of evidence suggest that subglacial sediment storage is small. Strong hysteresis in the relationship between sediment and water discharge argues for sediment exhaustion from the subglacial system on seasonal and flood event timescales. Uplift of the glacier surface during periods of enhanced basal motion reflects intimate contact of the glacier sole with up-glacier-inclined stoss slopes of bedrock bumps. Sediment evacuation rates at Bench Glacier should therefore closely track glacial erosion rates over annual timescales. Much of the sediment emerges in a major pulse that closely follows the termination of enhanced sliding each year, suggesting that the conduits and well-connected cavities that allowed removal of englacial water to terminate sliding also promoted efficient transport of sediment. This small glacier efficiently modifies the landscape, lowering its bed by 1–2 mm/yr while sliding only 1–2 m/yr. Our sparse measurements of instantaneous bed load discharge average 41\% of concurrent suspended sediment discharge. Assuming that half of the suspended load derives from abrasion of subglacially quarried clasts, roughly two thirds of the sediment evacuated can be attributed to quarrying.},

Glacial erosion rate is usually modelled as a function of glacier sliding velocity, but the empirical basis for this relationship is weak. In turn, climate is assumed to control sliding velocity and hence erosion, but this too lacks empirical scrutiny. Here, we present statistically robust relationships between erosion rates, sliding velocities, and climate from a global compilation of 38 glaciers. We show that sliding is positively and significantly correlated with erosion, and derive a relationship for use in erosion models. Our dataset further demonstrates that the most rapid erosion is achieved at temperate glaciers with high mean annual precipitation, which serve to promote rapid sliding. Precipitation has received little attention in glacial erosion studies, but our data illustrate its importance.},

	abstract = {We evaluate changes to subglacial sediment discharge during glacier retreat by considering ice dynamics, bedrock erosion, and sediment transport processes. Coupling these components together within a single framework, we simulate sediment discharge from synthetic alpine glaciers experiencing accelerated glacier melt for 100 years. We find that sediment discharge increases by about 8 times the steady glacier values by the end of the simulation. The enhanced sediment discharge persists through peak water discharge and despite annual bedrock erosion volume decreasing by approximately 30\% from the initial value. The greater sediment discharge results from increased melt at the glaciers' higher region, where transport was limited prior to glacier retreat. These findings suggest that large increases in sediment discharge may occur as glaciers retreat. The magnitude of the sediment discharge increase primarily depends on the quantity of sediment stored subglacially.},

	abstract = {An analysis of temporal variability in proglacial suspended sediment concentration is undertaken using time series data collected from three Svalbard basins which include one largely cold-based glacier (Austre Brøggerbreen), one largely warm-based glacier (Finsterwalderbreen) and one intermediate polythermal glacier (Erdmannbreen). The temporal variability in proglacial suspended sediment concentration is analysed using multiple regression techniques in which discharge is supplemented by other predictors acting as surrogates for variability in sediment supply at diurnal, medium-term and seasonal timescales. These multiple regression models improve upon the statistical explanation of suspended sediment concentration produced by simple sediment rating curves but need to account for additional stochastic elements within the time series before they may be considered successful. An interpretation of the physical processes which are responsible for the regression model characteristics is offered as a basis for comparing the different arctic glaciofluvial suspended sediment transport systems with that of their better known temperate glaciofluvial counterparts. It is inferred that the largely warm-based glacier is dominated by sediment supply from subglacial reservoirs which evolve in a similar manner to temperate glaciers and which cause a pronounced seasonal exhaustion of suspended sediment supply. The largely cold-based glacier, however, is dominated by sediment supply from marginal sources which generate a responsive system at short time scales but no significant seasonal pattern. The intermediate polythermal glacier basin, which was anticipated to be similar to the warm-based glacier, instead shows a highly significant seasonal increase in suspended sediment supply from an unusual subglacial reservoir emerging under pressure in the glacier foreland. The temperate model of glaciofluvial suspended sediment transport is therefore found to be of limited use in an arctic context. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Here we calibrate satellite imagery to estimate suspended sediment concentration for 160 proglacial rivers across Greenland. Combining these suspended sediment reconstructions with numerical calculations of meltwater runoff, we quantify the amount and spatial pattern of sediment export from the ice sheet. We find that, although runoff from Greenland represents only 1.1\% of the Earth’s freshwater flux, the Greenland ice sheet produces approximately 8\% of the modern fluvial export of suspended sediment to the global ocean. Sediment loads are highly variable between rivers, consistent with observed differences in ice dynamics and thus with control by glacial erosion. Rivers that originate from deeply incised, fast-moving glacial tongues form distinct sediment-export hotspots: just 15\% of Greenland’s rivers transport 80\% of the total sediment load of the ice sheet. We conclude that future acceleration of melt and ice sheet flow may increase sediment delivery from Greenland to its fjords and the nearby ocean.},

	abstract = {Dispersed facies basal ice – massive (i.e. structureless) ice with dispersed debris aggregates – is present at the margins of many glaciers and, as a product of internal glacial processes, has the potential to provide important information about the mechanisms of glacier flow and the nature of the subglacial environment. The origin of dispersed facies is poorly understood, with several hypotheses having been advanced for its formation, and there is disagreement as to whether it is largely a sedimentary or a tectonic feature. We test these established hypotheses at the temperate glacier Svínafellsjökull, Iceland, and find that none fully account for dispersed facies characteristics at this location. Instead, dispersed facies physical, sedimentological and stable-isotope (δ18O, δD) characteristics favour a predominantly tectonic origin that we suggest comprises the regelation and strain-induced metamorphism of debris-rich basal ice that has been entrained into an englacial position by tectonic processes operating at the base of an icefall. Further thickening of the resultant dispersed facies may also occur tectonically as a result of ice flow against the reverse bed slope of a terminal overdeepening. Lack of efficient subglacial drainage in the region of the overdeepening may limit basal melting and thus favour basal ice preservation, including the preservation of dispersed facies. Despite the relatively low sediment content of dispersed facies ( ∼1.6\% by volume), its thickness (up to 25 m) and ubiquity at Svínafellsjökull results in a significant contribution to annual sediment discharge (1635–3270 m3 a−1) that is ∼6.5 times that contributed by debris-rich stratified facies basal ice.},

In contrast, the estimated combined flux of subglacial and supraglacially derived meltwaters is of the order of 4 km3/a. Iceberg melt within the fjord accounts for half of the freshwater delivered to the fjord from all sources. Iceberg appear to lose their subglacial debris during their lenghty residence time (2 year) within the sikussaks pinned to the ice margins. Once icebergs escape the confines of the sikussaks, they transit the fjord in about 68 days, melting at rates between 0.05 and 0.1 m/d and releasing englacial sediment to a mid-water, iceberg melt zone. Sedimentation beneath this plume is predicted to range from 2.4 cm/a, near the head of the fjord, to 0.6 cm/a at the most distal (50 km) part of the fjord basin. Much of the sediment that initially accumulates on the steep sidewall margins becomes remobilized and redeposited on the distal basin floor via turbidity currents. Predicted accumulation rates agree with long-term (1400 year) rates obtained from dated cores collected in Kangerdlugssuaq Fjord.},

At our site, only negligible amounts of debris are released through englacial, supraglacial or subglacial sediment transfer. Glaciofluvial sediment production is highly localized, and long sections of the ice-sheet margin receive no sediment from glaciofluvial sources. These findings differ from those of studies at more temperate glacial settings where glaciofluvial routes are dominant and basal ice contributes only a minor percentage of the debris released at the margin.

Therefore, understanding how the production of sediments by glacial erosion has evolved in the past, and will evolve in a changing climate, is increasingly important. In this Review, we examine the processes that control the magnitude and timing of glacial erosion of mountains, and how models can be used to reconstruct processes during the development of mountains. Field observations reveal the important role of sliding on the erosion rate, which provide an empirical basis to explain the glacial buzzsaw and the impact of late Cenozoic cooling on erosion rates. Glacial erosion is also expected to evolve in the context of anthropogenic climate warming, as both glacier sliding and the input of meltwater related to thinning and retreat of ice will change, with large effects on downstream ecosystems and global biogeochemical cycles. Thus, the mechanics and impacts of glaciers on sediment production warrant more research, especially in regions experiencing rapid warming. Above all, there is a need for better monitoring of how erosion rates changed over the last decades and will evolve in the future.},

	abstract = {Glaciers expel large amounts of water and sediments, and the discharge of both is influenced by glacier retreat. Because the majority of sediment originates subglacially, as opposed to proglacially, focus must be given to subglacial sediment discharge. The latter, however, is poorly constrained. We present a subglacial sediment transport time-series from the Gornergletscher and Aletschgletscher catchments in the Swiss Alps, based on hourly suspended sediment transport data and bedload transport estimates. This dataset is used to identify interannual and regional variability and to quantify the relationship between sediment transport and water discharge. Analysis of the relationship suggests that the access of water to subglacial sediment exerts substantial control on the quantity of sediment discharged. Historical data from Gornergletscher since the 1970's show that elevated amounts of sediment were discharged in the 1980's, following the onset of increasing glacier melt. However, by 2016 and 2017, the sediment discharge had returned to quantities below those in the 1970's, suggesting that sediment discharge may return to an equilibrium over decadal times scales following the onset of a new hydrological regime. Erosion rates for the two catchments (0.28 mm a−1 to 0.49 mm a−1) are lower than in other glacierized catchments of the Swiss Alps ({\textasciitilde}1 mm a−1). In some years in both catchments, these rates are even less than a third of those reported in earlier decades, highlighting substantial regional and interannual variability in catchment-scale erosion. Empirical models of the relationship between sediment concentration and water discharge, calibrated with the presented 2016–2017 data, fail to capture the elevated sediment discharge over the 1980's. This suggests that processes other than runoff, such as changing access to subglacial sediment by meltwater, were responsible for the increase. Subglacial sediment discharge depends on both water discharge and sediment availability. Therefore, we argue that physically-based models of subglacial sediment transport, that can capture its complex temporal and spatial evolution in response to glacier retreat, are needed to predict and understand a glacier's sediment yield.},

	abstract = {Proglacial suspended sediment transport was monitored at Haut Glacier d'Arolla, Switzerland, during the 1998 melt season to investigate the mechanisms of basal sediment evacuation by subglacial meltwater. Sub-seasonal changes in relationships between suspended sediment transport and discharge demonstrate that the structure and hydraulics of the subglacial drainage system critically influenced how basal sediment was accessed and entrained. Under hydraulically inefficient subglacial drainage at the start of the melt season, sediment availability was generally high but sediment transport increased relatively slowly with discharge. Later in the melt season, sediment transport increased more rapidly with discharge as subglacial meltwater became confined to a spatially limited network of channels following removal of the seasonal snowpack from the ablation area. Flow capacity is inferred to have increased more rapidly with discharge within subglacial channels because rapid changes in discharge during highly peaked diurnal runoff cycles are likely to have been accommodated largely by changes in flow velocity. Basal sediment availability declined during channelization but increased throughout the remainder of the monitored period, resulting in very efficient basal sediment evacuation over the peak of the melt season. Increased basal sediment availability during the summer appears to have been linked to high diurnal water pressure variation within subglacial channels inferred from the strong increase in flow velocity with discharge. Basal sediment availability therefore appears likely to have been increased by (1) enhanced local ice-bed separation leading to extra-channel flow excursions and[sol ]or (2) the deformation of basal sediment towards low-pressure channels due to a strong diurnally reversing hydraulic gradient between channels and areas of hydraulically less-efficient drainage.

In this Review, we summarize landscape changes in cold environments and provide a global inventory of increases in erosion and sediment yield driven by cryosphere degradation. Anthropogenic climate change, deglaciation, and thermokarst disturbances are causing increased sediment mobilization and transport processes in glacierized and periglacierized basins. With continuous cryosphere degradation, sediment transport will continue to increase until reaching a maximum (peak sediment). Thereafter, transport is likely to shift from a temperature-dependent regime toward a rainfall-dependent regime roughly between 2100–2200. The timing of the regime shift would be regulated by changes in meltwater, erosive rainfall and landscape erodibility, and complicated by geomorphic feedbacks and connectivity. Further progress in integrating multisource sediment observations, developing physics-based sediment-transport models, and enhancing interdisciplinary and international scientific collaboration is needed to predict sediment dynamics in a warming world.},

	abstract = {Mendenhall Glacier is a dynamic maritime glacier in southeast Alaska that is undergoing substantial recession and thinning. The terminus has retreated 3 km during the 20th century and the lower part of the glacier has thinned 200 m or more since 1909. Glacier-wide volume loss between 1948 and 2000 is estimated at 5.5 km3. Wastage has been the strongest in the glacier's lower reaches, but the glacier has also thinned at higher elevations. The shrinkage of Mendenhall Glacier appears to be due primarily to surface melting and secondarily to lake calving. The change in the average rate of thinning on the lower glacier, {\textless}1 m a−1 between 1948 and 1982 and {\textgreater}2 m a−1 since 1982, agrees qualitatively with observed warming trends in the region. Mean annual temperatures in Juneau decreased slightly from 1947 to 1976; they then began to increase, leading to an overall warming of ∼1.6 °C since 1943. Lake calving losses have periodically been a small but significant fraction of glacier ablation. The portion of the terminus that ends in the lake is becoming increasingly vulnerable to calving because of a deep pro-glacial lake basin. If current climatic trends persist, the glacier will continue to shrink and the terminus will recede onto land at a position about 500 m inland within one to two decades. The glacier and the meltwaters that flow from it are integral components of the Mendenhall Valley hydrologic system. Approximately 13\% of the recent average annual discharge of the Mendenhall River is attributable to glacier shrinkage. Glacier melt contributes 50\% of the total river discharge in summer.},

	abstract = {Soils on Holocene-age moraines of the Mendenhall Glacier in southeast Alaska range from morphologically undeveloped to soils having field-identified spodic horizons that are more strongly expressed with increasing soil age. A soil chronosequence was sampled to study development of spodic features and to compare the expression of these features with chemical and micromorphological properties. Organic C accumulates rapidly in these soils, with O horizons forming within 38 yr. Organic C is highly correlated with cation exchange capacity (R2 = 0.92), variable charge (R2 = 0.94), extractable acidity (R2 = 0.83), and 1500-kPa water retention (R2 = 0.97). The pH of the 10-yr old pedon is acidic with a soil pH (H20) ranging from 5.0 to 6.4. The pH decreases with soil age, with the lowest pH in horizons at the organic/mineral contact. Increases in dithionite-citrate, sodium pyrophosphate, and acid-oxalate extractable Fe (Feo) are most evident in the {\textgreater} 240-yr old soil. Depth trends for these measured properties within pedons are most distinctive for Fe. which increases from surface mineral horizons (A or E) to underlying horizons in all pedons. The Feo/Fed ratio increases with soil age in B horizons, and in pedons ≥ 70 yr, this ratio ranges from 0.3 to 0.5 in the E horizons and from 0.4 to 0.83 in B horizons immediately below. These data indicate a greater proportion of poorly crystalline Fe in illuvial horizons with increasing soil age. Allophane content is low ({\textless} 6 g kg−1) in these pedons, and there is no consistent increase with soil age. The optical density of acid-oxalate extract (ODOE) and Alo+ 1/2 Feo are sensitive and consistent chemical indicators of spodic development. The ODOE increases with soil age in B horizons (0.06 to 0.56). The Alo + 1/2 Fe0 also increases with soil age in B horizons (1.2 to 4.5 g kg-1) and within pedons from E to B horizons. Nonoccluded Ca-bound P (195 to 49 mg kg−1) and total P (700 to 300 mg kg−1) decrease in E horizons relative to underlying horizons with soil age. Surface horizons of the younger pedons are predominantly aggregates of uncoated sand-sized grains with few organic constituents. Early processes of eluviation are evidenced by the etching of mineral grains in the E horizon of the 70-yr old pedon. There is no optical evidence of Fe-oxide accumulation in these soils, with the exception of the BC horizon of the {\textgreater} 240-yr old pedon. This chronosequence study indicates that spodic development is achieved within a relatively short period of time in soils of this region.},

Overall, the JIF is losing mass less rapidly (0.13 ± 0.12 m w.e. a–1) than other Alaskan icefields (0.79 m w.e. a–1). We determine glacier speeds using pixel-tracking on optical image pairs acquired from 2001 to 2010 by ASTER, from radar image pairs acquired between 2007 and 2011 and from radar interferometry in 1995. We detect seasonal speed variations but no interannual acceleration, ruling out dynamics as the cause of the observed thinning. Thinning must therefore be due to the documented warming in the region. Flux measurements confirm this for Mendenhall Glacier, showing that calving constitutes only 2.5–5\% of mass loss there.},

The RGI was created with limited resources in a short period. Priority was given to completeness of coverage, but a limited, uniform set of attributes is attached to each of the {\textasciitilde}198 000 glaciers in its latest version, 3.2. Satellite imagery from 1999–2010 provided most of the outlines. Their total extent is estimated as 726 800 ± 34 000 km2. The uncertainty, about ±5\%, is derived from careful single-glacier and basin-scale uncertainty estimates and comparisons with inventories that were not sources for the RGI. The main contributors to uncertainty are probably misinterpretation of seasonal snow cover and debris cover. These errors appear not to be normally distributed, and quantifying them reliably is an unsolved problem. Combined with digital elevation models, the RGI glacier outlines yield hypsometries that can be combined with atmospheric data or model outputs for analysis of the impacts of climatic change on glaciers. The RGI has already proved its value in the generation of significantly improved aggregate estimates of glacier mass changes and total volume, and thus actual and potential contributions to sea-level rise.},

	abstract = {Knowing the ice thickness distribution of a glacier is of fundamental importance for a number of applications, ranging from the planning of glaciological fieldwork to the assessments of future sea-level change. Across spatial scales, however, this knowledge is limited by the paucity and discrete character of available thickness observations. To obtain a spatially coherent distribution of the glacier ice thickness, interpolation or numerical models have to be used. Whilst the first phase of the Ice Thickness Models Intercomparison eXperiment (ITMIX) focused on approaches that estimate such spatial information from characteristics of the glacier surface alone, ITMIX2 sought insights for the capability of the models to extract information from a limited number of thickness observations. The analyses were designed around 23 test cases comprising both real-world and synthetic glaciers, with each test case comprising a set of 16 different experiments mimicking possible scenarios of data availability. A total of 13 models participated in the experiments. The results show that the inter-model variability in the calculated local thickness is high, and that for unmeasured locations, deviations of 16\% of the mean glacier thickness are typical (median estimate, three-quarters of the deviations within 37\% of the mean glacier thickness). This notwithstanding, limited sets of ice thickness observations are shown to be effective in constraining the mean glacier thickness, demonstrating the value of even partial surveys. Whilst the results are only weakly affected by the spatial distribution of the observations, surveys that preferentially sample the lowest glacier elevations are found to cause a systematic underestimation of the thickness in several models. Conversely, a preferential sampling of the thickest glacier parts proves effective in reducing the deviations. The response to the availability of ice thickness observations is characteristic to each approach and varies across models. On average across models, the deviation between modeled and observed thickness increase by 8.5\% of the mean ice thickness every time the distance to the closest observation increases by a factor of 10. No single best model emerges from the analyses, confirming the added value of using model ensembles.},

The foundations of today's models were laid decades ago, inspired by measurements from mountain glaciers, discovery of the modern ice streams and the study of landscapes evacuated by former ice sheets. Models have progressed from strict adherence to the principles of groundwater flow, to the incorporation of flow ‘elements’ specific to the subglacial environment, to sophisticated two-dimensional representations of interacting distributed and channelized drainage. Although presently in a state of rapid development, subglacial drainage models, when coupled to models of ice flow, are now able to reproduce many of the canonical phenomena that characterize this coupled system. Model calibration remains generally out of reach, whereas widespread application of these models to large problems and real geometries awaits the next level of development.},

	abstract = {The influence of glacier hydrology on the time-dependent morphology and flow behaviour of the late Weichselian Scandinavian ice sheet is explored using a simple one-dimensional ice sheet model. The model is driven by orbitally induced radiation variations, ice-albedo feedback and eustatic sea-level change. The influence of hydrology is most marked during deglaciation and on the southern side of the ice sheet, where a marginal zone of rapid sliding, thin ice and low surface slopes develops. Such a zone is absent when hydrology is omitted from the model, and its formation results in earlier and more rapid deglaciation than occurs in the no-hydrology model. The final advance to the glacial maximum position results from an increase in the rate of basal sliding as climate warms after 23000 yr BP. Channelised subglacial drainage develops only episodically, and is associated with relatively low meltwater discharges and high hydraulic gradients. The predominance of iceberg calving as an ablation mechanism on the northern side of the ice sheet restricts the occurrence of surface melting. Lack of meltwater penetration to the glacier bed in this area means that ice flow is predominantly by internal deformation and the ice sheet adopts a classical parabolic surface profile.},

	abstract = {There is increasing geologic evidence for periodic flow variability within large ice sheets, manifested as spatially and temporally variable areas of fast ice flow, and resulting in the very complex patterns of lineations observed in formerly glaciated areas. However, many ice sheet models do not replicate this behaviour. A possible reason for this is that such models do not include a detailed treatment of basal hydrology. Changes in the character of sub-glacial drainage systems are believed to cause surges in valley glaciers. Recent ice sheet models, which have included basal hydrology or at least a link between basal velocity and the presence of water at the bed, often show flow variability. However, these models have typically assumed a deformable bed, or have made no assumptions about the nature of the bed. Whilst these assumptions seem applicable to areas close to the former margins of Quaternary ice sheets, they are less applicable to interior areas. These areas typically show thin or scanty till cover over eroded bedrock, and the presence of eskers, which are indicative of drainage in sub-glacial tunnels. We have developed a two-dimensional time-dependent ice sheet model that includes hard-bed basal hydrology. This allows calculation of sub-glacial water pressures and the use of a water pressure dependent sliding law to calculate ice sheet velocities. When used to simulate the Weichselian Scandinavian ice sheet, with late Quaternary climate and sea level as forcing functions, this model develops localised areas of fast-flowing ice, which vary in extent and in distance of penetration into the interior of the ice sheet both spatially and temporally. The behaviour of these lobes depends crucially on the influence of the evolving ice sheet topography on the routing of subglacial water flow, due to the resulting variations in the subglacial hydraulic potential which drive the water flow. Bedrock topography also has some influence, but fast flow areas are not confined to obvious topographic troughs. A relatively thin ice sheet with low surface slopes is produced in areas experiencing fast ice flow. Generally, two to four separate areas of fast flow can be recognised, and these are similar in size and shape to the ‘lobes’ identified in some geologically based reconstructions of the Scandinavian ice sheet. Within the fast-flowing areas, sub-glacial drainage is typically in a cavity-based system. However, tunnel-based drainage is predicted to have extended up to 150km from the ice sheet margin, particularly during deglaciation. Because of the changes in ice sheet topography associated with fast flow, and the resulting changes in the pattern of sub-glacial water flow, the model predicts that these fast-flowing lobes interacted in complex ways, and exhibited quasi-periodic switching between fast and slow flow.},

	abstract = {The objective of this research is to contribute to the understanding of the thermal regime of Alaska and its relationship to geology, regional tectonics, and to suggest potential sites for future geothermal energy production. New heat flow data were collected and are combined with existing published and unpublished data, although large sections of Alaska still lack data. Fault traces were implemented into the heat flow contouring as an additional gridding constraint, to incorporate both heat flow measurements and geology. New heat flow data supported the use of geologic trends in the heat flow mapping procedure, and a heat flow map of Alaska was produced with this added constraint. The multi-input contouring strategy allows production of a map with a regional interpretation of heat flow, in addition to site-specific heat flow and thermal model interpretations in areas with sufficient data density.Utilizing the new heat flow map, temperature-at-depth curves were created for example areas. Temperature-at-depth curves are calculated to 10 km depth for the areas of Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau, the Alaska Peninsula, Bristol Bay, and the Copper River Basin. The temperatures-at-depth predicted near the population centers of Anchorage and Juneau are relatively low, limiting the geothermal resource potential. The Fairbanks area temperature estimates are near conventional power production temperatures (150 °C) between 3.5 and 4 km. All data areas, except at Juneau, have temperatures sufficient for low temperature geothermal applications (40 °C) by 2 km. A high heat flow region exists within the Aleutian Volcanic Arc, although new data show heat flow variations from 59 to 120 mW m-2, so individual geothermal resources within the arc will be irregularly located.},

We present results of experiments in which pressurized ice at its melting temperature is slid over a water-saturated till bed.

Here we demonstrate that detailed analysis of seismic ground motion caused by subglacial water flow at Mendenhall Glacier (Alaska) allows for continuous measurement of daily to subseasonal changes in basal water pressure gradient, channel size, and sediment transport. We observe intermittent subglacial water pressure gradient changes during the melt season, at odds with common assumptions of slowly varying, low-pressure channels. These observations indicate that changes in channel size do not keep pace with changes in discharge. This behavior strongly affects glacier dynamics and subglacial channel erosion at Mendenhall Glacier, where episodic periods of high water pressure gradients enhance glacier surface velocity and channel sediment transport by up to 30\% and 50\%, respectively. We expect the application of this framework to future seismic observations acquired at glaciers worldwide to improve our understanding of subglacial processes.},

Since it has been shown that sediment at the base can account for the majority of ice movement, it is suggested that there is a deforming bed/debris-rich continuum whereby similar processes occur throughout the different subglacial environments. These include: similar longitudinal deformation patterns (compression at the margin, extension and simple shear up-glacier); similar vertical deformation patterns, increase in deformation (and fabric strength) upwards through the sequence (leading to the attenuation of stratified ice into dispersed ice); and similar and interrelated incorporation processes.

These measurements show that debris entrainment has occurred without alteration of the glacial ice, and provide the most direct evidence to date that active entrainment occurs at the beds of cold glaciers, without bulk freezing of water. Entrainment at subfreezing temperatures may have formed the U-shaped trough containing Meserve Glacier. In addition to possibly allowing some cold-based glaciers to be important geomorphic agents, entrainment at subfreezing temperatures provides a general mechanism for formation of the dirty basal layers of polar glaciers and ice sheets, which are rheologically distinct and can limit the time span of ice-core analyses. Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that geomorphologists should abandon the assumption that cold-based glaciers do not slide and abrade their beds.},

The formation of each is investigated on the basis of its debris distribution, sedimentology, and stable isotope composition. Isotopic data are interpreted within an analytical framework that allows for variations in the isotopic composition of source waters. Ice facies formed by metamorphism are distinguished from those formed by open-system refreezing within basal cavities and from those formed by closed-system regelation. Individual basal ice facies are thereby linked to the subglacial physical conditions required for their formation.

	abstract = {The basal ice layer of surge-type Variegated Glacier, Alaska, appears to have formed by a combination of (i) open-system freezing of subglacial meltwaters over both rigid and unconsolidated substrates; (ii) apron over-riding during surge-induced glacier advance; (iii) incorporation of glacier ice by recumbent folding, thrust-faulting and nappe over-riding during down-glacier propagation of a surge front; and (iv) post-formational metamorphism involving recrystallization, partial internal melting and squeezing out of meltwaters and dissolved gases. Structural evidence and the characteristics of debris entrained in ice facies formed by basal freezing suggest that the layer includes a lower element formed under surge conditions and an upper element formed during the quiescent phase of a surge cycle. The lower element is depleted in comminution products and enriched in medium gravel, while the upper element contains comminution products but virtually no medium gravel. This distinction is attributed to the efficiency of bedrock fracture and meltwater flushing of comminution products under surge conditions. The basal ice layer thickens from {\textless}1 m to {\textgreater}13 m down-glacier in a manner consistent with the magnitude of horizontal shortening induced by the 1982–83 surge. Thickening is largely tectonic in origin, and the style and intensity of folding and thrust faulting change down-glacier as the magnitude of horizontal shortening increases. Tectonic processes associated with the down-glacier propagation of surge fronts therefore appear to be capable of creating thick basal ice layers which allow extensive supraglacial sedimentation of subglacially derived debris.},

	abstract = {We have constructed a numerical model of basal ice formation for glacier ice in contact with subglacial sediment. The model predicts four different ice facies whose formation is controlled by availability of subglacial water to satisfy the basal freeze-on rate. Clean (or clotted) facies may result from congelation (or frazil) ice growth occurring when (supercooled) meltwater separates ice base from substrate or if a groundwater source can supply water to the ice base at a velocity equal to the freezing rate. Laminated facies develops when the supply of subglacial water is sufficiently constrained for cryostatic suction to raise the subglacial effective stress above a threshold for intrusion of ice into sediment by regelation. Debris laminas (∼1 mm) are entrained by short, periodic regelation events (of a few hours) separated by longer periods (days to months) of congelation. Further meltwater limitation produces a massive dirty ice facies due to stacking of debris laminas. The model predicts growth of solid dirty ice facies when the bed is meltwater-depleted with fast freezing (5 mm yr−1) causing enhanced erosion (30 mm yr−1). We find that basal ice facies and sediment entrainment are controlled mainly by the ratio of freezing rate to water supply rate. The predicted ice facies compare favorably with borehole camera imagery of the basal ice layer in Kamb Ice Stream, West Antarctica. Facies variability in this layer suggests complex hydrologic history for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet with significant changes occurring over a period of several thousand years.},

	abstract = {Based on sediment cores and geophysical data collected from Petermann Fjord and northern Nares Strait, NW Greenland, an Arctic ice shelf sediment facies is presented that distinguishes sub and pro ice shelf environments. Sediment cores were collected from sites beneath the present day Petermann Ice Tongue (PIT) and in deglacial sediments of northern Nares Strait with a focus on understanding the glacial and oceanographic history over the last 11,000 cal yr BP. The modern sub ice shelf sediment facies in Petermann Fjord is laminated and devoid of coarse clasts (IRD) due to strong basal melting that releases debris (debris filtering) from the basal ice at the grounding zone driven by buoyant subglacial meltwater and entrained Atlantic Water. Laminated sediments in the deep basin proximal to the gounding zone comprise layers of fine mud formed by suspension settling from turbid meltwater plumes (plumites) interrupted by normally graded very fine sand to medium silt layers with sharp basal contacts and rip-up clasts of mud, interpreted as turbidites. An inner fjord sill limits distribution of sediment gravity flows from the grounding zone to the deep inner fjord basin, such that sites on the inner sill and beyond the ice tongue largely only comprise plumites. Bioturbation and foraminiferal abundances increase with distance from the grounding zone. The benthic foraminiferal species, Elphidium clavatum is absent beneath the ice tongue, but dominant in the turbid meltwater influenced environment beyond the ice tongue. The very sparse IRD in sediments beneath the PIT and in the fjord beyond the PIT derives mainly from englacial debris in the ice tongue, side valley glaciers, rock falls from the steep fjord walls and sea ice. We use the modern ice shelf sediment facies characteristics to infer the past presence of ice shelves in northern Nares Strait using analyses of sediment cores from several cruises (OD1507, HLY03, 2001LSSL, RYDER19). On bathymetric highs, bioturbated mud with dispersed IRD overlies a 10–15 m thick, distinctly laminated silt and clay unit with rare coarse clasts and sparse foraminifera which forms a sediment drape of nearly uniform thickness. We interpret these laminated sediments to represent glaciomarine deposition by meltwater plumes emanating from ice streams that terminated in floating ice shelves. IRD layers, shifts in sediment composition (qXRD, MS and XRF) and faunal assemblage changes in the laminated unit document periods of ice-shelf instability sometimes, but not always, coupled with grounding zone retreat. Our deglacial reconstruction, including ice shelves, begins ∼10.7 cal ka BP, with confluent ice streams grounded in Hall Basin fronted by the Robeson Channel ice shelf. Ice shelf breakup and grounding zone retreat to relatively stable grounding zones at Kennedy Channel and the mouth of Petermann Fjord was accomplished by 9.4 cal ka BP when the Hall Basin ice shelf was established. This ice shelf broke up and reformed once prior to the final break up at 8.5 to 8.4 cal ka BP marking ice stream collapse, separation of Greenland and Innuitian ice sheets, and the opening of Nares Strait for Arctic-Atlantic throughflow. The Petermann ice shelf remained in Hall Basin until the Petermann Glacier retreated from the fjord mouth ∼7.1 cal ka BP. The resilience of these northern ice streams to strong early Holocene insolation and subsurface Atlantic Water advection is attributed to their northern aspect, buttressing by narrow passages, and high ice flux from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS).},

	abstract = {The Whales Deep Basin in eastern Ross Sea was occupied by the paleo-Bindschadler Ice Stream during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Previous studies showed that megascale glacial lineations (MSGLs) extend to the continental shelf edge. In a landward direction, these lineations are buried by an overlapping stack of backstepped grounding zone wedges (GZWs). The constraints require that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) grounded at least seven times within 60km of the shelf edge but the morphological relationships in the Whales Deep Basin cannot be used to uniquely reveal the magnitudes of either grounding line and/or calving front retreat and re-advance between the successive groundings. Here we show a new regional transect of cores from the basin which demonstrates that there were no major back and forth oscillations of either the grounding line or calving front during the overall retreat of grounded and floating ice. Instead, the new sedimentologic data show that a small ice shelf formed as the grounding line retreated from the shelf edge and backstepped over the outer continental shelf. An event bed records breakup of the ice shelf that covered the outer shelf. The stratal relationships indicate that the ice-shelf collapse occurred during the fourth grounding and that the grounding line remained on the outer continental shelf for three additional groundings. We infer that accelerated ice stream flow (due to loss of buttressing) increased sediment flux to the grounding line and thinned the WAIS at the grounding line. Following the seventh grounding, thinning contributed to an abrupt 200km retreat of the grounding line to the middle continental shelf and a large ice shelf re-formed over the middle continental shelf. A series of small-scale moraine ridges formed as the grounding line shifted south towards Roosevelt Island. The facies relationships on the middle continental shelf indicate that the calving front then shifted abruptly to its modern position. The ground-truth of the seafloor geomorphology presented here is important because it is a necessary framework for constraining retreat chronology for a central part of the WAIS that was not influenced by East Antarctic Ice Sheet overflow.},

	abstract = {Summary This map and associated digital databases are the result of compilation and interpretation of published and unpublished 1:250,000-scale and limited 1:500,000- to 1:63,360-scale maps. Covering the entire state of Alaska, it reflects more than a century of work by a host of geologists and almost two decades of compilation work. There are two versions of the map: a detailed digital version, and a simplified, “generalized” map for print. The map units described in the accompanying pamphlet reflect those of the detailed digital map. At the end of each unit description, the generalized map unit for that unit is listed. Compilation of this map began in September 1996, using available 1:250,000-scale data to compile and release a regional map of central Alaska (Wilson and others, 1998). An ongoing iterative process was used to describe and correlate individual geologic units to produce the units for this statewide map and its interim products—a series of regional geologic map compilations—which were released as the process continued (in the references cited in the pamphlet that are shown with an *). As additional geologic data were acquired, previously released data, correlations, and interpretations were updated as needed. Compilation of this map was complex, because the original source maps were made by different generations of geologists, mapping with very different ideas. Several of the older maps were completed before the concepts of accreted (suspect) terranes or even plate tectonics existed. On the other hand, some of the more recent maps were so governed by terrane analysis that conventional stratigraphic nomenclature was not used or is obscured. We adopted a traditional stratigraphic approach and avoided use of the sometimes controversial and commonly inconsistently defined or applied terrane terminology. Our decision to adopt a traditional approach is evident in a map that emphasizes the age and lithology of map units, rather than differences among fault-bounded packages of rocks. We did our best to resolve conflicting interpretations and map data from the regional compilations and from the individual source maps in areas where regional compilations had not been produced. We made every effort to preserve the original geologic map information, incorporating, where available, new data, but we were careful to not overinterpret the geologic data. Yet even our willingness to make interpretations and revisions did not enable us in some areas to resolve mapping conflicts or to reconcile different mapping styles. Therefore, there are several areas on the map where map units are separated by “quadrangle boundary faults.” More data and fieldwork may allow resolution of these conflicts. This Alaska compilation is unique in that it is integrated with a rich database of information provided in the spatial datasets and standalone attribute databases. Within the spatial files every line and polygon is attributed},

Landlab is an open-source Python package that contains modularized elements of numerical models for Earth's surface, thus reducing time required for researchers to create new or reimplement existing models.

Landlab also contains components – modular implementations of single physical processes – and a suite of utilities that support numerical methods, input/output, and visualization. This contribution describes package development since version 1.0 and backward-compatibility-breaking changes that necessitate the new major release, version 2.0. Substantial changes include refactoring the grid, improving the component standard interface, dropping Python 2 support, and creating 31 new components – for a total of 58 components in the Landlab package. We describe reasons why many changes were made in order to provide insight for designers of future packages.

Once trained with representative data, we demonstrate that IGM permits to model mountain glaciers up to 1000 × faster than Stokes ones on Central Processing Units (CPU) with fidelity levels above 90\% in terms of ice flow solutions leading to nearly identical transient thickness evolution. Switching to the GPU often permits additional significant speed-ups, especially when emulating Stokes dynamics or/and modelling at high spatial resolution. IGM is an open-source Python code which deals with two-dimensional (2-D) gridded input and output data. Together with a companion library of trained ice flow emulators, IGM permits user-friendly, highly efficient and mechanically state-of-the-art glacier and icefields simulations.},

	abstract = {Due to climatic change, many Alpine glaciers have significantly retreated during the last century. In this study we perform the numerical simulation of the temporal and spatial change of Rhonegletscher, Swiss Alps, from 1874 to 2007, and from 2007 to 2100. Given the shape of the glacier, the velocity of ice u is obtained by solving a 3D nonlinear Stokes problem with a nonlinear sliding law along the bedrock–ice interface. The shape of the glacier is updated by computing the volume fraction of ice φ, which satisfies a transport equation. The accumulation due to snow fall and the ablation due to melting is accounted by adding a source term to the transport equation. A decoupling algorithm allows the two above problems to be solved using different numerical techniques. The nonlinear Stokes problem is solved on a fixed, unstructured finite element mesh consisting of tetrahedrons. The transport equation is solved using a fixed, structured grid of smaller cells. The numerical simulation, from 1874 to 2007, is validated against measurements. Afterwards, three different climatic scenarios are considered in order to predict the shape of Rhonegletscher until 2100. A dramatic retreat of Rhonegletscher during the 21st century is anticipated. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the impact of climatic change on mountain glaciers.},

	abstract = {The shallow shelf approximation, a balance of membrane stresses for ice flow, is an effective “sliding law” for ice sheet modeling. Our use of it as a sliding law becomes a standard model for ice stream flow when the sliding velocity is large (100 m a−1 and faster). Following Schoof (2006a), we describe the basal resistance as plastic till for which the yield stress is given by a Mohr-Coulomb formula. Pore water pressure is related to basal melt rate. The velocity field used in the mass continuity and conservation of energy equations is an average of velocities from the shallow shelf approximation and the nonsliding shallow ice approximation. Using this scheme, our model has realistic, time-dependent ice streams which exhibit the range of surface velocities seen in actual ice streams. We demonstrate the model at high spatial resolution (5 km grid) over multiple millenia using its implementation in the Parallel Ice Sheet Model. Numerical experiments show that the entire scheme is stable with respect to many parameter changes. Some experiments reveal significant ice stream variability in a hypothetical steady climate, with characteristic cycles on the order of 1000 years. We believe this is the first practical whole ice sheet model with a unified treatment of vertical shear stresses and membrane stresses. It is capable of high-resolution, thermomechanically coupled, multimillenia simulations of ice sheets containing ice streams.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the ice thickness distribution of the world’s glaciers is a fundamental prerequisite for a range of studies. Projections of future glacier change, estimates of the available freshwater resources or assessments of potential sea-level rise all need glacier ice thickness to be accurately constrained. Previous estimates of global glacier volumes are mostly based on scaling relations between glacier area and volume, and only one study provides global-scale information on the ice thickness distribution of individual glaciers. Here we use an ensemble of up to five models to provide a consensus estimate for the ice thickness distribution of all the about 215,000 glaciers outside the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The models use principles of ice flow dynamics to invert for ice thickness from surface characteristics. We find a total volume of 158 ± 41 × 103 km3, which is equivalent to 0.32 ± 0.08 m of sea-level change when the fraction of ice located below present-day sea level (roughly 15\%) is subtracted. Our results indicate that High Mountain Asia hosts about 27\% less glacier ice than previously suggested, and imply that the timing by which the region is expected to lose half of its present-day glacier area has to be moved forward by about one decade.},

Failing to find these distributions that are required as initial conditions leads to a disequilibrium between mass balance and ice flow, resulting in nonphysical transient effects in the prognostic model. Here we tackle this problem by inverting an emulator of the Stokes ice flow model based on deep learning. By substituting the ice flow equations using a convolutional neural network emulator, we simplify, make more robust and dramatically speed up the solving of the underlying optimization problem thanks to automatic differentiation, stochastic gradient methods and implementation of graphics processing unit (GPU). We demonstrate this process by simultaneously inferring the ice thickness distribution, ice flow parametrization and ice surface of ten of the largest glaciers in Switzerland. As a result, we obtain a high degree of assimilation while guaranteeing an equilibrium between mass-balance and ice flow mechanics. The code runs very efficiently (optimizing one large-size glacier at 100 m takes {\textless} 1 min on a laptop) while it is open-source and publicly available.},

	abstract = {Each summer, large volumes of surface meltwater drain off the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) surface through moulins to the bed, impacting subglacial hydrology and ice flow dynamics. Supraglacial surface routing delays may propagate to englacial and subglacial hydrologic systems, requiring accurate assessment to correctly estimate subglacial effective pressures. We compare hourly supraglacial moulin discharge simulations from three surface meltwater routing models – the synthetic unit hydrograph (SUH), the bare-ice component of surface routing and lake filling (SRLF), and the rescaled width function (RWF) – for four internally drained catchments on the southwestern Greenland ice sheet surface. The routing models are forced identically using surface runoff from the Modèle Atmosphérique Régionale regional climate model (RCM). For each catchment, simulated moulin hydrographs are input to the SHAKTI subglacial hydrologic model to simulate diurnally varying subglacial effective-pressure variations in the vicinity of a single moulin. Overall, all three routing models produce more realistic moulin discharges than simply using RCM runoff outputs without surface routing but produce significant differences in peak moulin discharge and time to peak. In particular, the RWF yields later, smaller peak moulin discharges than the SUH or SRLF due to its representation of slow interfluve flow between supraglacial meltwater channels, and it can readily accommodate the seasonal evolution of supraglacial stream and river networks. Differences among the three routing models are reflected in a series of simple idealized subglacial hydrology simulations that yield different diurnal effective-pressure amplitudes; however, the supraglacial hydrologic system acts as short-term storage for surface meltwater, and the temporal mean effective pressure is relatively consistent across routing models.},

	abstract = {Subglacial hydrology has a strong influence on glacier and ice sheet dynamics, particularly through the dependence of sliding velocity on subglacial water pressure. Significant challenges are involved in modeling subglacial hydrology, as the drainage geometry and flow mechanics are constantly changing, with complex feedbacks that play out between water and ice. A clear tradition has been established in the subglacial hydrology modeling literature of distinguishing between channelized (efficient) and sheetlike (inefficient or distributed) drainage systems or components and using slightly different forms of the governing equations in each subsystem to represent the dominant physics. Specifically, many previous subglacial hydrology models disregard opening by melt in the sheetlike system or redistribute it to adjacent channel elements in order to avoid runaway growth that occurs when it is included in the sheetlike system. We present a new subglacial hydrology model, SHAKTI (Subglacial Hydrology and Kinetic, Transient Interactions), in which a single set of governing equations is used everywhere, including opening by melt in the entire domain. SHAKTI employs a generalized relationship between the subglacial water flux and the hydraulic gradient that allows for the representation of laminar, turbulent, and transitional regimes depending on the local Reynolds number. This formulation allows for the coexistence of these flow regimes in different regions, and the configuration and geometry of the subglacial system evolves naturally to represent sheetlike drainage as well as systematic channelized drainage under appropriate conditions. We present steady and transient example simulations to illustrate the features and capabilities of the model and to examine sensitivity to mesh size and time step size. The model is implemented as part of the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM).},

	abstract = {Sediment discharge from glaciers impacts downstream aquatic habitats, hydropower operations, and river infrastructure. Since discharge of subglacial sediment will evolve in response to glacier retreat, estimating future subglacial sediment dynamics is of great relevance. To develop tools and methods to better constrain the responsible processes, we present a till dynamics model that accounts for limited sediment access coupled to a subglacial hydrology model to describe the evolution of a subglacial till layer over a glacier's longitudinal profile in one dimension. Synthetic simulations examining the effects of changing hydrology highlight the importance of properly constraining both the erosion of underlying bedrock and the subglacial sediment connectivity. This is because changes in hydrology alter the timing of peak sediment discharge but only marginally affect total sediment discharge once the subglacial sediment reservoir is exhausted. Model simulations for real-world glaciers yield insights into the distribution of sediment along the glacier bed, including locations where sediments are deposited or exhausted. Comparison between model results and field data shows that total and peak sediment discharge, as well as interannual variability, can be captured with acceptable skill for periods ranging from hours to decades. The results from this model show that modeling subglacial sediment transport on decadal to subdaily scales is possible but requires processes such as bedrock erosion and sediment connectivity to be considered.},

	abstract = {We present a two-dimensional Glacier Drainage System model (GlaDS) that couples distributed and channelized subglacial water flow. Distributed flow occurs through linked cavities that are represented as a continuous water sheet of variable thickness. Channelized flow occurs through Röthlisberger channels that can form on any of the edges of a prescribed, unstructured network of potential channels. Water storage is accounted for in an englacial aquifer and in moulins, which also act as point sources of water to the subglacial system. Solutions are presented for a synthetic topography designed to mimic an ice sheet margin. For low discharge, all the flow is accommodated in the sheet, whereas for sufficiently high discharge, the model exhibits a channelization instability which leads to the formation of a self-organized channel system. The random orientation of the network edges allows the channel system geometry to be relatively unbiased, in contrast to previous structured grid-based models. Under steady conditions, the model supports the classical view of the subglacial drainage system, with low pressure regions forming around the channels. Under diurnally varying input, water flows in and out of the channels, and a rather complex spatiotemporal pattern of water pressures is predicted. We explore the effects of parameter variations on the channel system topology and mean effective pressure. The model is then applied to a mountain glacier and forced with meltwater calculated by a temperature index model. The results are broadly consistent with our current understanding of the glacier drainage system and demonstrate the applicability of the model to real settings.},

Going beyond previous work, we study the uniqueness of solutions in depth, finding that non-unique solutions are possible under very specialized circumstances. Further, in an extension of work by Campos, Oden and Kikuchi, we show that solutions to the regularized Coulomb friction and power law problems converge to the Coulomb friction problem in appropriate parametric limits, provided the latter is unique, and briefly discuss the implications of possible non-unique solutions for a priori error estimation in numerical approximations.},

	abstract = {To predict the distribution of motion beneath glaciers on soft beds, the strength of the coupling between the ice and the bed and its variation with effective pressure must be known. A record of shear strain, acquired with a tiltmeter emplaced in till beneath Storglaciären, Sweden, indicates that fluctuations in water pressure cause variations in the local shear stress on the bed and that the bed deforms elastically in response to these variations. To estimate the shear stress from the elastic component of the total shear strain, the shear modulus of the till was measured in relaxation tests conducted in the laboratory with a ring-shear device. After accounting for the elastic compliance of the device, these tests yielded shear moduli of about 1000 and 1800 kPa at confining pressures of 85 and 280 kPa, respectively. These values are comparable to those of other granular materials undergoing recoverable shear strains of the same magnitude. The local shear stress on the till, calculated by applying the measured shear moduli to the tilt record, scales with Pe1.7, where Pe is the effective pressure. This relation implies that as Pe decreases at the ice/till interface, shear stresses on the till are reduced and concentrated elsewhere on the bed, perhaps where the till is absent or the glacier is frozen to the bed. When compared with the strength of the till determined from ring-shear tests, this relation also accounts for the lack of permanent deformation at depth in the bed during periods of low Pe and indicates that most basal motion was by sliding or ploughing.},

The resultant sediment flux impacts glacier dynamics and rates of subglacial erosion over a range of timescales, but its fundamental dependencies are not well understood. Using a cryogenic ring shear device, we conducted experiments to investigate the effects of both effective stress and slip speed on rates of till transport. Sediment fluxes were computed using digital image correlation from a photographic time series of the till bed. We find a near-linear relationship between sediment flux and slip speed, but a non-monotonic, double-valued dependency of sediment flux on effective stress. Deformation primarily occurred in a thin shear band near the ice sole, the thickness of which could vary with both parameters. Coupling between ice and till increased at higher slip speeds and effective stresses and scaled the magnitude of the flow profile.},

We show that suspended sediment contributes \&lt;20\% of the total clastic sediment discharge into Iceberg Lake, an Alaskan proglacial lake. Drainage of this lake in 1999 exposed outcrops of varved lacustrine sediment that record suspended sediment deposition. Since a Little Ice Age highstand two centuries ago, lake level has dropped in four abrupt spillway-controlled events that are recorded stratigraphically as transient increases in the basinwide deposition of unusually fine grained sediments. Varve counting constrains ages of these events and, hence, of each abandoned shoreline and associated delta. Volumes of deltaic and lake-floor sediments constrain specific yields from four multidecadal intervals between A.D. 1825 and 1999. Total yield ranges from 3.8 to 4.9 × 103 t·km−2·yr−1, and most of the sediment (81\%–86\%) is sand and gravel now in the deltas. A range of evidence suggests that sediment yield faithfully records upstream sediment production in this small (66 km2) and heavily glacierized basin, implying an effective subglacial erosion rate of 1.6 mm/yr. These data show that estimates of total yield based upon suspended sediment alone are subject to large errors and suggest that quarrying accounts for a large fraction of the glacial erosion in this system.},

Following ice-front advance of 1.0–1.5 km into Tsivat and Tsiu Lakes, the basins were significantly altered by surge-related sedimentation including the impact of a subglacial outburst into Tsivat Lake. The subsequent changes in basin shape, size, and morphology were monitored by six bathymetric surveys. Measured changes in water depth serve as a proxy for determining increments of sediment accumulation. Upwelling, ice-front vents fed by subglacial tunnels transported suspended fine sediment directly into the lake system. The rate of suspension settling within both lakes varied from 0.6 to 1.2 m year−1 prior to the surge. Suspended load during surge years increased sixfold from 1.7 to 13.9 g l−1, accompanied by increased sediment accumulation of 2.2–3.1 m year−1. Vent-related aggradation and subsequent filling of Tsivat Lake caused sediment bypassing to Tsiu Lake, where encroachment by delta growth contributed to a postsurge rate of bottomset accumulation of 3.0 m year−1. The total sediment influx from subglacial sources is represented by the sum of bathymetrically determined accumulation, plus an estimated volume of sediment that remained suspended, thus passing through the lake system. Total sediment flux along the eastern Bering piedmont lobe from 1991 to 2000 is approximately 227 million cubic meters.},

	abstract = {The sediments stored in the large, deep proglacial lakes of south-central Alaska are largely unstudied. We analyzed sediments in 20 cores, up to 160 cm long, from Eklutna, Kenai, and Skilak Lakes, using a combination of repeated lamination counting, radionuclide dating, event stratigraphy, and tephrochronology. We show that the characteristically rhythmic layers were deposited annually. Most of these glacial varves consist of one coarse-grained base and a fine-grained top, but varves composed of multiple coarse-grained turbidite pulses are common too. They are likely related to successive episodes of high sediment discharge during flooding, and they become more frequent in all three lakes, along with increased sedimentation rates, during the nineteenth century late phase of the Little Ice Age. These flood turbidites were generated by rain events and intense melting of snow and ice. Other (mega) turbidites are a result of earthquake-triggered slope collapses (e.g., A.D. 1964). Some event layers are present in all three lakes. In addition, the annual time series of varve thickness (normalized annual sedimentation rate) are significantly correlated among the three lakes (ρ \&gt; 0.27; p \&lt; 0.001). Differences between the varve thickness records can be attributed partly to the dam construction at Eklutna Lake and outbursts from an ice-dammed lake at Skilak Lake. Geomorphologic differences among the catchments result in further differences in sedimentation patterns in the three lakes.},

	abstract = {Glaciers fluctuate in response to climate change and record these changes by building sedimentary landforms, including moraines. Therefore, glacial landscapes are a potentially valuable archive of terrestrial palaeoclimate change. Typically, a cooling climate causes glaciers to expand and a warming climate causes glaciers to shrink. However, the glacier response time and the influence of mountainous topography on glacier dynamics complicates this behaviour, such that moraines are not always a straightforward indicator of glacier change in response to climate change. We used a glacial landscape evolution model to simulate the response of a hypothetical mountain glacier to simple changes in climate and the resulting formation and preservation of moraines. These results show that the rate of climate change relative to the glacier response time determines the geometry, number, and position of moraines. Glaciers can build distinct moraines in the absence of climate change. The distance from the maximum ice extent may not represent the chronological order of moraine formation. Moraines can be preserved after being overrun and eroded by subsequent glaciations, but moraine sequences may also contain gaps that are unidentifiable in the field.},

The hummocky/ribbed moraine zone can be geomorphologically linked to the subaqueous Göteborg Moraine, formed at an oscillation/stand-still phase during the deglaciation of the Swedish west coast. Based on detailed sedimentological and structural investigations of ribbed moraine ridges it is concluded that diamict sequences and associated sorted sediment were deposited due to passive melt-out from stagnant, debris-rich ice with synsedimentary deposition of sorted sediments, preferentially at a melting ice/bed interface. To accommodate for the geomorphological expression, such an interpretation further implies that debris-rich ice formed in an intermediate adfreezing zone between ice at the pressure-melting point and a frontal frozen zone at deglaciation. Basal debris-rich ice was stacked into transversally arranged zones (controlled moraine), forming ribbed moraine ‘embryos’, the active phase of ridge formation. The stacked sequences of debris-rich ice eventually melted out beneath a stable and melt-retarding supraglacial ablation complex to form the final moraine ridges, the passive phase of ridge formation. In areas with no stable supraglacial ablation complex, the resulting landform after final de-icing was a hummocky moraine landscape. Internal composition of moraine hummocks suggests that most of them are composed of sediment gravity flow sediments, intercalated with stream-deposited sediments, all resting on a platform of subglacial melt-out till. De-icing of the zone now occupied by hummocky and ribbed moraine took a considerable time; deglacial 14C age differences from lake basins on either side of the geomorphic boundary to the streamlined terrain indicate a separation between active and stagnant ice along that boundary, and that it took another 200–300yr for the stagnant ice zone to melt during the final formation of present-day landforms.},

	abstract = {Grounding-zone wedges (GZWs) are asymmetric sedimentary depocentres which form through the rapid accumulation of glacigenic debris along a line-source at the grounding zone of marine-terminating ice sheets during still-stands in ice-sheet retreat. GZWs form largely through the delivery of deforming subglacial sediments. The presence of GZWs in the geological record indicates an episodic style of ice retreat punctuated by still-stands in grounding-zone position. Moraine ridges and ice-proximal fans may also build up at the grounding zone during still-stands of the ice margin, but these require either considerable vertical accommodation space or sediment derived from point-sourced subglacial meltwater streams. By contrast, GZWs form mainly where floating ice shelves constrain vertical accommodation space immediately beyond the grounding-zone. An inventory of GZWs is compiled from available studies of bathymetric and acoustic data from high-latitude continental margins. The locations and dimensions of GZWs from the Arctic and Antarctic, alongside a synthesis of their key architectural and geomorphic characteristics, are presented. GZWs are only observed within cross-shelf troughs and major fjord systems, which are the former locations of ice streams and fast-flowing outlet glaciers. Typical high-latitude GZWs are less than 15km in along-flow direction and 15 to 100m thick. GZWs possess a transparent to chaotic acoustic character, which reflects the delivery of diamictic subglacial debris. Many GZWs contain seaward-dipping reflections, which indicate sediment progradation and wedge-growth through continued delivery of basal sediments. GZW formation is inferred to require high rates of sediment delivery to a fast-flowing ice margin that is relatively stable for probably decades to centuries. Although the long-term stability of the grounding zone is controlled by ice-sheet mass balance, the precise location of any still-stands is influenced strongly by the geometry of the continental shelf. The majority of high-latitude GZWs occur at vertical or lateral pinning points, which encourage grounding-zone stabilisation through increasing basal and lateral drag and reducing mass flow across the grounding zone.},

Failing to find these distributions that are required as initial conditions leads to a disequilibrium between mass balance and ice flow, resulting in nonphysical transient effects in the prognostic model. Here we tackle this problem by inverting an emulator of the Stokes ice flow model based on deep learning. By substituting the ice flow equations using a convolutional neural network emulator, we simplify, make more robust and dramatically speed up the solving of the underlying optimization problem thanks to automatic differentiation, stochastic gradient methods and implementation of graphics processing unit (GPU). We demonstrate this process by simultaneously inferring the ice thickness distribution, ice flow parametrization and ice surface of ten of the largest glaciers in Switzerland. As a result, we obtain a high degree of assimilation while guaranteeing an equilibrium between mass-balance and ice flow mechanics. The code runs very efficiently (optimizing one large-size glacier at 100 m takes {\textless} 1 min on a laptop) while it is open-source and publicly available.},

Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction–diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.},

However, the dependence on an ensemble of realisations of an instructor model renders this strategy difficult to generalise to a variety of ice-flow regimes found in the nature. To overcome this issue, we adopt the approach of physics-informed deep learning, which fuses traditional numerical solutions by finite differences/elements and deep-learning approaches. Here, we train a CNN to minimise the energy associated with high-order ice-flow equations within the time iterations of a glacier evolution model. As a result, our emulator is a promising alternative to traditional solvers thanks to its high computational efficiency (especially on GPU), its high fidelity to the original model, its simplified training (without requiring any data), its capability to handle a variety of ice-flow regimes and memorise previous solutions, and its relatively simple implementation. Embedded into the ‘Instructed Glacier Model’ (IGM) framework, the potential of the emulator is illustrated with three applications including a large-scale high-resolution (2400x4000) forward glacier evolution model, an inverse modelling case for data assimilation, and an ice shelf.},

We formulate the {\textbackslash}textit\{variational residual\} of the PDE using the DNN approximation by incorporating the variational form of the problem into the loss function of the network and construct a {\textbackslash}textit\{variational physics-informed neural network\} (VPINN). By integrating by parts the integrand in the variational form, we lower the order of the differential operators represented by the neural networks, hence effectively reducing the training cost in VPINNs while increasing their accuracy compared to PINNs that essentially employ delta test functions. For shallow networks with one hidden layer, we analytically obtain explicit forms of the {\textbackslash}textit\{variational residual\}. We demonstrate the performance of the new formulation for several examples that show clear advantages of VPINNs over PINNs in terms of both accuracy and speed.},

Previous coupled hydro-mechanical models, however, describe cavity-driven friction and hydraulic transmissivity independently, resulting in a physically inconsistent cavity evolution between the two components of the models. Here, we overcome this issue by describing the hydro-mechanical system using a common cavity-evolution description, that governs both transient friction and hydraulic transmissivity. We show that our coupling approach is superior to previous formulations in explaining a unique observation record of glacier sliding speed from the French Alps. We find that, at multi-day to multi-decadal timescales, sliding speed can be expressed as a direct function of basal shear stress and water discharge, without accounting for water pressure, which simply adjusts to maintain the cavitation ratio needed to accommodate the water supply.},

We show that during stick-slip tremor at the base of an Alpine glacier, the released seismic moment increases by an order of magnitude. The tremor emerges during melt-intensive days and is associated with water pressure peaks in a nearby subglacial channel. We propose an extended slider-block model that explains the regular occurrence of stick-slip tremor by coupling seismically sliding patches to surrounding aseismically sliding bed regions. The model predicts that the stick-slip patches control the movement of their surrounding smoothly sliding bed regions via elastic coupling and stress transfer. Thus, tremor producing stick-slip patches could affect large-scale ice flow to a degree, which is underestimated in models, with implications on sea level rise projections.},

Here we use results from a set of laboratory experiments to examine the transient response of glacier slip over a hard bed to velocity perturbations. The drag and cavity evolution from lab experiments are used to parameterize a rate-and-state drag model that is applied to observations of surface velocity and ice-bed separation from the Greenland ice sheet. The drag model successfully predicts observed lags between changes in ice-bed separation and sliding speed. These lags result from the time (or displacement) required for cavities to evolve from one steady-state condition to another. In comparing drag estimates resulting from applying rate-and-state and steady-state slip laws to transient data, we find the peaks in drag are out of phase. This suggests that in locations where subglacial conditions vary on timescales shorter than those needed for cavity adjustment transient slip processes control basal drag.},

We map present-day Antarctic-wide surface velocities using Landsat 7 and 8 imagery spanning 2013–2015 and compare to earlier estimates derived from synthetic aperture radar, revealing heterogeneous changes in ice flow since ∼ 2008. The new mapping provides complete coastal and inland coverage of ice velocity north of 82.4° S with a mean error of \&lt; 10 m yr−1, resulting from multiple overlapping image pairs acquired during the daylight period. Using an optimized flux gate, ice discharge from Antarctica is 1929 ± 40 Gigatons per year (Gt yr−1) in 2015, an increase of 36 ± 15 Gt yr−1 from the time of the radar mapping. Flow accelerations across the grounding lines of West Antarctica's Amundsen Sea Embayment, Getz Ice Shelf and Marguerite Bay on the western Antarctic Peninsula, account for 88 \% of this increase. In contrast, glaciers draining the East Antarctic Ice Sheet have been remarkably constant over the period of observation. Including modeled rates of snow accumulation and basal melt, the Antarctic ice sheet lost ice at an average rate of 183 ± 94 Gt yr−1 between 2008 and 2015. The modest increase in ice discharge over the past 7 years is contrasted by high rates of ice sheet mass loss and distinct spatial patters of elevation lowering. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is experiencing high rates of mass loss and displays distinct patterns of elevation lowering that point to a dynamic imbalance. We find modest increase in ice discharge over the past 7 years, which suggests that the recent pattern of mass loss in Antarctica is part of a longer-term phase of enhanced glacier flow initiated in the decades leading up to the first continent-wide radar mapping of ice flow.},

We observe intermittent subglacial water pressure gradient changes during the melt season, at odds with common assumptions of slowly varying, low-pressure channels. These observations indicate that changes in channel size do not keep pace with changes in discharge. This behavior strongly affects glacier dynamics and subglacial channel erosion at Mendenhall Glacier, where episodic periods of high water pressure gradients enhance glacier surface velocity and channel sediment transport by up to 30\% and 50\%, respectively. We expect the application of this framework to future seismic observations acquired at glaciers worldwide to improve our understanding of subglacial processes.},

The classical, single-particle, theory of regelation is here extended to transverse, longitudinal, and square infinite arrays of cylindrical particles, for the case, as in soils, where heat-conduction is the rate-governing process. Detailed maps are presented of the steady thermal fields required for steady regelation, independent of the mechanism of melting point perturbation. For space-filling configurations of particles, steady regelation requires an overall macroscopic temperature gradient, associated with a systematic overall gradient of ice pressure. Four distinct heat flow paths are found on the microscopic scale: through the particle; through the ice from hot to cold surfaces of the one particle; through the ice between the hot surface of one particle and the cold surface of its neighbor; through ice alone down the macroscopic temperature gradient. The apparent hydraulic conductivity of the configuration to ice (K) is calculated. It is estimated that, for a soil with porosity 0.5 and with thermal conductivity 1.5 times that of ice, K = 2.7×10−11ms−1. In the course of the work, three approximations inherent in the classical theory are examined, and justified, through study of the energy balance during regelation.},

Tunnels there provide access to the bed beneath 213 m of ice. Pore-water pressure was regulated in the prism by pumping water to it. During experiments lasting 7–12 days, the glacier regelated downward into the prism to depths of 50–80 mm, accreting ice-infiltrated till at rates predicted by theory. During periods of sustained high pore-water pressure (70–100\% of overburden), ice commonly slipped over the prism, due to a water layer at the prism surface. Deformation of the prism was activated when this layer thinned to a sub-millimeter thickness. Shear strain in the till was pervasive and decreased with depth. A model of slip by ploughing of ice-infiltrated till across the prism surface accounts for the slip that occurred when effective pressure was sufficiently low or high. Slip at low effective pressures resulted from water-layer thickening that increased non-linearly with decreasing effective pressure. If sufficiently widespread, such slip over soft glacier beds, which involves no viscous deformation resistance, may instigate abrupt increases in glacier velocity.},

Ice-infiltrated sediment, or frozen fringe, is responsible for phenomena such as frost heave, ice lenses and metres of debris-rich ice under glaciers. Understanding frozen fringes is important as frost heave is responsible for damaging infrastructure at high latitudes and sediment freeze-on at the base of glaciers can modulate subglacial friction, influencing the rate of global sea level rise. Here we describe the thermomechanics of liquid water flow and freezing in ice-saturated sediments, focusing on the conditions relevant for subglacial environments. The force balance that governs the frozen fringe thickness depends on the weight of the overlying material, the thermomolecular force between ice and sediments across liquid premelted films and the water pressure required by Darcy flow. We combine this mechanical model with an enthalpy method that conserves energy across phase change interfaces on a fixed computational grid. The force balance and enthalpy model together determine the evolution of the frozen fringe thickness and our simulations predict frost heave rates and ice lens spacing. Our model accounts for premelting at ice–sediment contacts, partial ice saturation of the pore space, water flow through the fringe, the thermodynamics of the ice–water–sediment interface and vertical force balance. We explicitly account for the formation of ice lenses, regions of pure ice that cleave the fringe at the depth where the interparticle force vanishes. Our model results allow us to predict the thickness of a frozen fringe and the spacing of ice lenses in subaerial and subglacial sediments.},

	abstract = {Small quantities of liquid water lining triple junctions in polycrystalline glacier ice form connected vein networks that enable material exchange with underlying basal environments. Diffuse debris concentrations commonly observed in ice marginal regions might be attributed to this mechanism. Following recent cryogenic ring-shear experiments, we observed emplacement along grain boundaries of loess particles several tens of microns in size. Here, we describe an idealized model of vein liquid flow to elucidate conditions favoring such particle transport. Gradients in liquid potential drive flow toward colder temperatures and lower solute concentrations, while deviations of the ice stress state from hydrostatic balance produce additional suction toward anomalously low ice pressures. Our model predicts particle entrainment following both modest warming along the basal interface resulting from anticipated natural changes in effective stress, and the interior relaxation of temperature and solute concentration imposed by our experimental protocols. Comparisons with experimental observations are encouraging, but suggest that liquid flow rates are somewhat higher and/or more effective at dragging larger particles than predicted by our idealized model with nominal parameter choices. Diffuse debris entrainment extending several meters above the glacier bed likely requires a more sophisticated treatment that incorporates effects of ice deformation or other processes.},

	abstract = {We present the concept and capabilities of IGM (https://github.com/jouvetg/igm), a Python-based modeling tool designed for efficiently simulating glacier evolution across various scales. IGM integrates ice thermomechanics, climate-driven surface mass balance, mass conservation, and other processes. Within IGM, the update of all physical model components involves a series of mathematical operations on horizontal raster grids, performed by the Tensorflow library. This design choice results in high parallelization capabilities, particularly beneficial when executed on GPU hardware. The most challenging aspect of parallelization within IGM is the ice flow model, which leverages a physics-informed convolutional neural network trained from high-order ice flow physics. Conversely, components like the positive-degree day surface mass balance or the enthalpy thermal scheme take advantage of pixel-wise parallelization. Beyond its computational efficiency, IGM offers a user-friendly coding structure and modularity to promote community development, an OGGM-based module for accessing the data, data assimilation through underlying automatic differentiation tools, and post-processing vizualization routines. We present a comprehensive workflow, which includes data preprocessing, inverse and forward modeling, and rendering of results, enabling the rapid modeling of any mountain glacier globally by providing its RGI ID within a few minutes.},

A wealth of approaches has recently been presented for inferring ice thickness from characteristics of the surface. With the Ice Thickness Models Intercomparison eXperiment (ITMIX) we performed the first coordinated assessment quantifying individual model performance. A set of 17 different models showed that individual ice thickness estimates can differ considerably – locally by a spread comparable to the observed thickness. Averaging the results of multiple models, however, significantly improved the results: on average over the 21 considered test cases, comparison against direct ice thickness measurements revealed deviations on the order of 10 ± 24 \% of the mean ice thickness (1σ estimate). Models relying on multiple data sets – such as surface ice velocity fields, surface mass balance, or rates of ice thickness change – showed high sensitivity to input data quality. Together with the requirement of being able to handle large regions in an automated fashion, the capacity of better accounting for uncertainties in the input data will be a key for an improved next generation of ice thickness estimation approaches.},

Here we calibrate satellite imagery to estimate suspended sediment concentration for 160 proglacial rivers across Greenland. Combining these suspended sediment reconstructions with numerical calculations of meltwater runoff, we quantify the amount and spatial pattern of sediment export from the ice sheet. We find that, although runoff from Greenland represents only 1.1\% of the Earth’s freshwater flux, the Greenland ice sheet produces approximately 8\% of the modern fluvial export of suspended sediment to the global ocean. Sediment loads are highly variable between rivers, consistent with observed differences in ice dynamics and thus with control by glacial erosion. Rivers that originate from deeply incised, fast-moving glacial tongues form distinct sediment-export hotspots: just 15\% of Greenland’s rivers transport 80\% of the total sediment load of the ice sheet. We conclude that future acceleration of melt and ice sheet flow may increase sediment delivery from Greenland to its fjords and the nearby ocean.},

A significant correlation is established between mass accumulation rates, normalized by surface runoff, and distance down-fjord. This enables calculating annual sediment flux at any fjord point based on nearby marine-terminating outlet glacier melt data. Findings reveal a total annual sediment flux of 1.324 + /− 0.79 Gt yr-1 over the period 2010-2020 from all marine-terminating glaciers to the fjords.

	abstract = {Greenland's bed topography is a primary control on ice flow, grounding line migration, calving dynamics, and subglacial drainage. Moreover, fjord bathymetry regulates the penetration of warm Atlantic water (AW) that rapidly melts and undercuts Greenland's marine-terminating glaciers. Here we present a new compilation of Greenland bed topography that assimilates seafloor bathymetry and ice thickness data through a mass conservation approach. A new 150 m horizontal resolution bed topography/bathymetric map of Greenland is constructed with seamless transitions at the ice/ocean interface, yielding major improvements over previous data sets, particularly in the marine-terminating sectors of northwest and southeast Greenland. Our map reveals that the total sea level potential of the Greenland ice sheet is 7.42 ± 0.05 m, which is 7 cm greater than previous estimates. Furthermore, it explains recent calving front response of numerous outlet glaciers and reveals new pathways by which AW can access glaciers with marine-based basins, thereby highlighting sectors of Greenland that are most vulnerable to future oceanic forcing.},

However, basal melt has not been included explicitly in assessments of ice-sheet mass loss so far. Here, we present the first estimate of the total and regional basal melt produced by the ice sheet and the recent change in basal melt through time. We find that the ice sheet’s present basal melt production is 21.4 +4.4/−4.0 Gt per year, and that melt generated by basal friction is responsible for about half of this volume. We estimate that basal melting has increased by 2.9 ± 5.2 Gt during the first decade of the 2000s. As the Arctic warms, we anticipate that basal melt will continue to increase due to faster ice flow and more surface melting thus compounding current mass loss trends, enhancing solid ice discharge, and modifying fjord circulation.},

	abstract = {The basal thermal state (frozen or thawed) of the Greenland Ice Sheet is under-constrained due to few direct measurements, yet knowledge of this state is becoming increasingly important to interpret modern changes in ice flow. The first synthesis of this state relied on inferences from widespread airborne and satellite observations and numerical models, for which most of the underlying datasets have since been updated. Further, new and independent constraints on the basal thermal state have been developed from analysis of basal and englacial reflections observed by airborne radar sounding. Here we synthesize constraints on the Greenland Ice Sheet's basal thermal state from boreholes, thermomechanical ice-flow models that participated in the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6), IceBridge BedMachine Greenland v4 bed topography, Making Earth Science Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) Multi-Year Greenland Ice Sheet Velocity Mosaic v1 and multiple inferences of a thawed bed from airborne radar sounding. Most constraints can only identify where the bed is likely thawed rather than where it is frozen. This revised synthesis of the Greenland likely Basal Thermal State version 2 (GBaTSv2) indicates that 33 \% of the ice sheet's bed is likely thawed, 40 \% is likely frozen and the remainder (28 \%) is too uncertain to specify. The spatial pattern of GBaTSv2 is broadly similar to the previous synthesis, including a scalloped frozen core and thawed outlet-glacier systems. Although the likely basal thermal state of nearly half (46 \%) of the ice sheet changed designation, the assigned state changed from likely frozen to likely thawed (or vice versa) for less than 6 \% of the ice sheet. This revised synthesis suggests that more of northern Greenland is likely thawed at its bed and conversely that more of southern Greenland is likely frozen, both of which influence interpretation of the ice sheet's present subglacial hydrology and models of its future evolution. The GBaTSv2 dataset, including both code that performed the analysis and the resulting datasets, is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6759384 (MacGregor, 2022).},

We map present-day Antarctic-wide surface velocities using Landsat 7 and 8 imagery spanning 2013–2015 and compare to earlier estimates derived from synthetic aperture radar, revealing heterogeneous changes in ice flow since ∼ 2008. The new mapping provides complete coastal and inland coverage of ice velocity north of 82.4° S with a mean error of \&lt; 10 m yr−1, resulting from multiple overlapping image pairs acquired during the daylight period. Using an optimized flux gate, ice discharge from Antarctica is 1929 ± 40 Gigatons per year (Gt yr−1) in 2015, an increase of 36 ± 15 Gt yr−1 from the time of the radar mapping. Flow accelerations across the grounding lines of West Antarctica's Amundsen Sea Embayment, Getz Ice Shelf and Marguerite Bay on the western Antarctic Peninsula, account for 88 \% of this increase. In contrast, glaciers draining the East Antarctic Ice Sheet have been remarkably constant over the period of observation. Including modeled rates of snow accumulation and basal melt, the Antarctic ice sheet lost ice at an average rate of 183 ± 94 Gt yr−1 between 2008 and 2015. The modest increase in ice discharge over the past 7 years is contrasted by high rates of ice sheet mass loss and distinct spatial patters of elevation lowering. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is experiencing high rates of mass loss and displays distinct patterns of elevation lowering that point to a dynamic imbalance. We find modest increase in ice discharge over the past 7 years, which suggests that the recent pattern of mass loss in Antarctica is part of a longer-term phase of enhanced glacier flow initiated in the decades leading up to the first continent-wide radar mapping of ice flow.},

We modify the standard sheet-flow parameterization within a coupled sheet–channel subglacial drainage model to smoothly transition between laminar and turbulent flow based on the locally computed Reynolds number in a physically consistent way (the ‘transition’ model). We compare the transition model to standard laminar and turbulent models to assess the role of the sheet-flow parameterization in reconciling observed and modelled water pressures under idealized and realistic forcing. Relative to the turbulent model, the laminar and transition models improve seasonal simulations by increasing winter water pressure and producing a more prominent late-summer water pressure minimum. In contrast to the laminar model, the transition model remains consistent with its own internal assumptions across all flow regimes. Based on the internal consistency of the transition model and its improved performance relative to the standard turbulent model, we recommend its use for transient simulations of subglacial drainage.},

In contrast, the estimated combined flux of subglacial and supraglacially derived meltwaters is of the order of 4 km3/a. Iceberg melt within the fjord accounts for half of the freshwater delivered to the fjord from all sources. Iceberg appear to lose their subglacial debris during their lenghty residence time (2 year) within the sikussaks pinned to the ice margins. Once icebergs escape the confines of the sikussaks, they transit the fjord in about 68 days, melting at rates between 0.05 and 0.1 m/d and releasing englacial sediment to a mid-water, iceberg melt zone. Sedimentation beneath this plume is predicted to range from 2.4 cm/a, near the head of the fjord, to 0.6 cm/a at the most distal (50 km) part of the fjord basin. Much of the sediment that initially accumulates on the steep sidewall margins becomes remobilized and redeposited on the distal basin floor via turbidity currents. Predicted accumulation rates agree with long-term (1400 year) rates obtained from dated cores collected in Kangerdlugssuaq Fjord.},

	abstract = {Almost 90\% of 39 m of core material recovered from Scoresby Sund and the adjacent East Greenland shelf is massive diamicton, interpreted to be formed predominantly by the release of iceberg rafted debris and reworking by iceberg scouring. There is also likely to be a contribution from suspension settling of fines derived from glaciofluvial sources. Model calculations suggest that the 14C derived Holocene sedimentation rate of 0.1-0.3 m 1000 yr−1 in Scoresby Sund can be accounted for mainly by iceberg rafting of debris. A further 4\% of core material is of gravel or coarse sand lenses, interpreted to reflect iceberg dumping of debris. Intensive iceberg scouring, which reworks sea floor sediments, is observed on acoustic records from over 30 000 km2 of the Scoresby Sund fiord system and the adjacent East Greenland shelf (69-72°N and 75°N). The rate of iceberg production from Greenland Ice Sheet outlet glaciers, and iceberg drift tracks on the shelf, suggests that iceberg rafting and scouring may be important over a significant proportion of the 500 000 km2 area above the shelf break. The relatively extensive modern occurrence of massive diamicton, formed by iceberg rafting and scouring, together with suspension settling of fines, suggests that it may also be a significant facies in the glacier-influenced geological record. The recognition in the geological record of the massive diamicton facies described above may also indicate the former presence of fast flowing ice sheet outlet glaciers.},

	abstract = {Glaciers erode their beds and the adjacent landscape by abrasion and plucking and entraining sediment on their way downwards driven by gravity. Ice becomes a sediment transport agent. To determine glacial transport of sediment, measurements of both the ice flux and its concentration of sediment are needed. Once glaciers reach the ocean, ice and its entrained sediment is released into the ocean by calving. Further transport takes place by icebergs. Quantification of IRD (ice-rafted debris) fluxes, which upon ultimate deposition on the ocean floor is an important climate indicator, becomes even more complicated as icebergs topple and differentially melt while being in transport. While the volume of tidewater glacier ice released by recent calving is quite well constrained by satellite measurements, there is a lack of measurements of the concentration of sediment within the moving ice. Here, we describe a method to collect samples of ice from icebergs systematically for the first time in Greenland together with a strategy to obtain representative samples. Our method is tested in Scoresby Sound, East Greenland in order to describe the transport of sediment into the fjord system related to calving from known glacial source areas. Our data clearly demonstrate that biased and sparse sampling potentially produces unrealistic values of sediment concentrations. Seventy-two samples from 24 icebergs had an average concentration of sediment of 35.5 g/L of ice with a standard deviation of 97\%, between the 24 individual icebergs. The origin of the sediment is related to specific source areas. Based on the samples, we present an estimate of the annual transport of sediment out of Scoresby Sound related to calving 100 (0.3–200) million t year−1. Finally, we discuss the uncertainties of our estimate.},

	abstract = {Sediment cores from three East Greenland fjords contain sediment lithofacies and depositional processes in an iceberg dominated glacial marine setting. Three major lithofacies, diamicton, fine-grained mud, and sand, are deposited by two processes, sediment rain-out and sediment gravity flows. The sediments in Kangerlussuaq Fjord are predominately fine-grained muds deposited by rain-out from icebergs and glacier meltwater, with sediment gravity flows acting as secondary agents of deposition. Miki Fjord records rain-out of fine-grained muds from a river plume emanating from a proglacial delta at the fjord head. Alternating units of diamicton and fine-grained mud in Nansen Fjord are deposited by sediment rain-out from icebergs; particle size is governed by the oceanographic conditions in the fjord at the time of deposition. Despite their proximity to each other, each fjord is distinguished by a distinct sedimentological signature: Kangerlussuaq Fjord has low total organic carbon contact, Miki Fjord has high mass magnetic susceptibility, and Nansen Fjord has high amounts of ice-rafted debris. Comparison of the East Greenland iceberg dominated and Alaska glacial meltwater dominated environments indicates few major differences between sediments deposited in these two settings. This similarity raises doubt as to how well glacial marine sedimentary sequences can be used to interpret and reconstruct differences between glacial marine environments in the past without knowledge of sediment accumulation rates, environmental conditions at the time of sediment deposition, and comparable sedimentological data between studies.},

Two free-drifting icebergs, 0.1 and 30.8 square kilometers in aerial surface area, and the surrounding waters were sampled in the northwest Weddell Sea during austral spring 2005. There was substantial enrichment of terrigenous material, and there were high concentrations of chlorophyll, krill, and seabirds surrounding each iceberg, extending out to a radial distance of ∼3.7 kilometers. Extrapolating these results to all icebergs in the same size range, with the use of iceberg population estimates from satellite surveys, indicates that they similarly affect 39\% of the surface ocean in this region. These results suggest that free-drifting icebergs can substantially affect the pelagic ecosystem of the Southern Ocean and can serve as areas of enhanced production and sequestration of organic carbon to the deep sea.},

Although anecdotal and small-scale surveys suggest that drifting icebergs increase local primary production, no large-scale studies have been reported. An analysis of satellite and automated iceberg tracking data from the Weddell Sea, covering the months October to March, from 1999 to 2004, showed that the probability of increased surface phytoplankton biomass was up to one-third higher in the wake of a tracked iceberg compared to background biomass fluctuations. Only during the month of February were the effects of icebergs on surface biomass likely to be negative, whereas background biomass fluctuations were likely to be negative during March. These results confirm icebergs as a factor affecting phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean and highlight the need for detailed process studies so that responses to future changes in the Antarctic ice sheets may be predicted.},

	abstract = {The North Atlantic sediment record suggests quasi-periodic (7000- to 12,000-year period) ice-rafted debris (IRD) depositions during at least the last glacial period. The cause of these Heinrich events, as they are commonly known, is not fully understood; however, they may point to surges of the ice stream that drained the Hudson Bay/Hudson Strait region of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. We investigate a simple conceptual model of ice stream instability (the binge/purge model) to suggest ways in which the ice stream could have entrained sufficient debris to account for the estimated mass of IRD associated with a typical Heinrich IRD layer in the North Atlantic (1.0 ± 0.3 × 1015 kg). We find that freezing of debris-laden ice at the bed of the ice stream during the brief (≈ 750 years) surge phase of the ice stream's hypothesized binge/purge cycle can incorporate up to 5.1 × 1015 kg. This amount is sufficient to meet the constraints of the North Atlantic sediment record but by no means verifies the binge/purge model as the cause of Heinrich events.},

We show, using in situ cosmogenic nuclides in ice-rafted debris, that the Laurentide Ice Sheet was likely more persistent during Quaternary interglacials than often thought. Low 26Al/10Be ratios (indicative of burial of the source area) in marine core sediment suggest sediment source areas experienced only brief (on the order of thousands of years) and/or infrequent ice-free interglacials over the past million years. These results imply that complete Laurentide deglaciation may have only occurred when climate forcings reached levels comparable to those of the early Holocene, making our current interglacial unusual relative to others of the mid-to-late Pleistocene.},

The path of the icebergs, clearly marked by the presence of ice-rafted detrital carbonate, can be traced for more than 3,000 km—a remarkable distance, attesting to extreme cooling of surface waters and enormous amounts of drifting ice. The cause of these extreme events is puzzling. They may reflect repeated rapid advances of the Laurentide ice sheet, perhaps associated with reductions in air temperatures, yet temperature records from Greenland ice cores appear to exhibit only a weak corresponding signal. Moreover, the 5–10,000-yr intervals between the events are inconsistent with Milankovitch orbital periodicities, raising the question of what the ultimate cause of the postulated cooling may have been.},

We propose that pulses of detrital carbonate-rich sediments in two cores from the northwestern Labrador Sea reflect episodes when an ice stream from the Hudson Strait extended to the shelf break and delivered sediment onto the slope and deep-sea plain. Atomic mass spectroscopy 14C dating of planktonic foraminifera in cores HU75-009-IV-55 (2.4 km water depth) and HU87-033-009 (1.4 km water depth and 150 km north-northwest), indicates that the youngest event occurred between ca.14 and 15 ka and another occurred between 19 and 21 ka.The two carbonate intervals in northwestern Labrador Sea cores are coeval with Heinrich events 1 and 2 in the eastern North Atlantic (lat 45°-50°N, long 20°W), where they are associated with an increase in lithic fragments and a drastic reduction in the numbers of foraminifera. These changes have been linked with the massive production of icebergs associated with ice-sheet surges. Our evidence indicates that Heinrich events 1 and 2 are associated with the dynamics of the Hudson Strait ice stream and denote considerable glaciological instability.},

This can be explained by the coupling of ice and sediment dynamics: a shoal forms at the glacier terminus, reducing ice discharge and causing advance towards an unstable configuration followed by abrupt retreat, in a process known as the tidewater glacier cycle. Here we use a numerical model calibrated with observations to show that interactions between ice flow, glacial erosion, and sediment transport drive these cycles, which occur independent of climate variations. Water availability controls cycle period and amplitude, and enhanced melt from future warming could trigger advance even in glaciers that are steady or retreating, complicating interpretations of glacier response to climate change. The resulting shifts in sediment and meltwater delivery from changes in glacier configuration may impact interpretations of marine sediments, fjord geochemistry, and marine ecosystems.},

	url = {https://doi.org/10.1130/SPE261-p75},
	abstract = {Climate is the first-order control on fluctuations of glacial tidewater termini. However, factors affecting relative water depth such as eustasy, isostasy, and sediment yield are important second-order controls on termini fluctuations. Deposition of grounding-line systems, which include ice-contact deltas, morainal banks, and grounding-line fans, can change relative water depth and consequently alter the stability of tidewater termini independent of climate. Therefore, the rate at which sediment accumulates in these grounding-line systems can control the rate of terminus movement. Modern temperate glaciers at Glacier Bay, Alaska, on average produce about 106 m3/yr of sediment, most of which accumulates at grounding lines. Sediment volume decreases logarithmically downfjord from a grounding line. In Glacier Bay, readvance rates that average about 10 m/yr are one to two orders of magnitude slower than retreat rates. Rates of glacial advance may be a function of sediment yield (determined by drainage area and rates of glacial erosion, transportation and debris release), total sediment volume of grounding-line systems (determined by fjord width, fjord depth less the maximum water depth for terminus stability, and angle of repose of sediment making the system), and sediment dispersal patterns (determined by process of debris release and dispersion, type of sediment, and marine currents). Consequently, average rates of advance are slower than retreat rates because of the time required for sediment to accumulate as a bathymetric high at a grounding line, which effectively decreases relative water depth and increases terminus stability. Retreat rates are faster because they occur during terminus instability in deep water and cannot be altered by sediment accumulation rates until quasi-stability of the terminus is caused by other means, such as bedrock pinning-points or a decrease in ablation area. As marine-ending glaciers expand, total sediment delivered to a grounding line increases; as they retreat, sediment volume decreases because of the change in size of the drainage basin. Grounding lines are the major depocenters receiving this sediment, and resulting lithofacies packages and geometries are primarily controlled by grounding-line movement over a glacial advance-retreat cycle. During glacial minima, fjords trap sediment while the continental shelf and slope are starved. During glacial advances and retreats, fjords are eroded while the continental shelf receives sediment and the slope may remain starved. At glacial maxima, fjords and commonly the shelf are eroded, and the continental slope receives sediment. Because grounding-line advance and retreat may or may not coincide with eustatic sea-level changes, the sedimentary record may vary depending on environmental settings and the magnitude of glacial cycles.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive ice-penetrating radar survey of a subglacial embayment and adjacent peninsula along the grounding zone of Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica. Through basal waveform and reflectivity analysis, we identify four distinct basal interfaces: (1) an ice-water-saturated till interface inland of grounding; (2) a complex interface in the grounding zone with variations in reflectivity and waveforms caused by reflections from fluting, sediment deposits, and crevasses; (3) an interface of anomalously low-reflectivity downstream of grounding in unambiguously floating areas of the embayment due to basal roughness and entrained debris; and (4) a high-reflectivity ice-seawater interface that occurs immediately seaward of grounding at the subglacial peninsula and several kilometers seaward of grounding in the embayment, occurring after basal debris and grounding zone flutes have melted off the ice bottom. Sediment deposition via basal debris melt-out occurs in both locations. The higher basal melt rate at the peninsula contributes to greater grounding line stability by enabling faster construction of a stabilizing sediment wedge. In the embayment, the low slopes of the ice bottom and bed prevent development of a strong thermohaline circulation leading to a lower basal melt rate and less rapid sediment deposition. Thus, grounding lines in subglacial embayments are more likely to lack stabilizing sediment deposits and are more prone to external forcing, whether from the ocean, the subglacial water system, or large-scale ice dynamics. Our conclusions indicate that subglacial peninsulas and embayments should be treated differently in ice sheet-ocean models if these models are to accurately simulate grounding line response to external forcing.},

Three major lithofacies, diamicton, fine-grained mud, and sand, are deposited by two processes, sediment rain-out and sediment gravity flows. The sediments in Kangerlussuaq Fjord are predominately fine-grained muds deposited by rain-out from icebergs and glacier meltwater, with sediment gravity flows acting as secondary agents of deposition. Miki Fjord records rain-out of fine-grained muds from a river plume emanating from a proglacial delta at the fjord head. Alternating units of diamicton and fine-grained mud in Nansen Fjord are deposited by sediment rain-out from icebergs; particle size is governed by the oceanographic conditions in the fjord at the time of deposition. Despite their proximity to each other, each fjord is distinguished by a distinct sedimentological signature: Kangerlussuaq Fjord has low total organic carbon contact, Miki Fjord has high mass magnetic susceptibility, and Nansen Fjord has high amounts of ice-rafted debris. Comparison of the East Greenland iceberg dominated and Alaska glacial meltwater dominated environments indicates few major differences between sediments deposited in these two settings. This similarity raises doubt as to how well glacial marine sedimentary sequences can be used to interpret and reconstruct differences between glacial marine environments in the past without knowledge of sediment accumulation rates, environmental conditions at the time of sediment deposition, and comparable sedimentological data between studies.},

Icebergs are also known to gouge the seafloor in water depths limited by their keel depth, thus representing a hazard to subsea infrastructure. Here, we provide evidence that icebergs can affect the seafloor at depths greater than their keel depth by triggering submarine landslides. Using repeat bathymetric surveys from multibeam echo sounders, we investigate the cause of a submarine landslide that occurred in Southwind Fjord, Baffin Island, between September 2018 and September 2019. This landslide is shown to be closely associated with recently formed iceberg pits at its headscarp carved by an iceberg that grounded and that capsized in the fjord in early September 2018. Geotechnical data from a nearby sediment core indicate that the vertical loading induced by the iceberg grounding and capsizing is sufficient to trigger the observed landslide. These results imply that icebergs originating from the Arctic, Greenland and Antarctica are hazards thousands of kilometres away from their original source and can affect continental slopes by triggering submarine landslides. This process represents an additional source of marine geohazards, especially if climate change leads to increased iceberg discharge.},

	abstract = {High latitude regions (≥ 50°N and ≥ 40°S) are thought to contribute substantially to contemporary global dust emissions which can influence biogeochemical cycling as well as geomorphic, cryospheric and atmospheric processes. However, there are few measurements of the emission or deposition of dust derived from these areas that extend beyond a single event or season. This article reports the deposition of locally-derived dust to an ice-free area of West Greenland over 2 years from 23 traps distributed across five sampling sites. Local dust sources include glacial outwash plains, glacially-derived delta deposits and the reworking of loessic soils. Annual dust deposition is estimated at 37.3 to 93.9 g m−2 for 2017–2018 and 9.74 to 28.4 g m−2 in 2018–2019. This annual variation is driven by high deposition rates observed in spring 2017 of 0.48 g m−2 d−1 compared to the range of 0.03 to 0.07 g m−2 d−1 during the rest of the monitoring period. The high deposition rates in spring 2017 were due to warmer than average conditions and high meltwater sediment supply that delivered large quantities of sediment to local outwash plains in 2016. For other seasons, dust deposition was lower over both autumn–winter periods (0.03 g m−2 d−1) than during the spring and summer (0.04–0.07 g m−2 d−1). When sediment availability is limited, dust deposition increases with increasing temperature and wind speed. Secondary data from dust-related weather type/observation codes and visibility records were found to be inconsistent with measured dust deposition during the period of study. One possible reason for this is the complex nature of the terrain between the observation and sample sites. The dust deposition rates measured here and the infidelity of the observed dust with secondary data sources reveal the importance of direct quantification of dust processes to accurately constrain the dust cycle at high latitudes.},

At our site, only negligible amounts of debris are released through englacial, supraglacial or subglacial sediment transfer. Glaciofluvial sediment production is highly localized, and long sections of the ice-sheet margin receive no sediment from glaciofluvial sources. These findings differ from those of studies at more temperate glacial settings where glaciofluvial routes are dominant and basal ice contributes only a minor percentage of the debris released at the margin.

Here we use a continuous ice core dust record from the Renland ice cap on the east coast of Greenland to constrain the timing of changes to the ice sheet margin and relative sea level over the last glacial cycle. During the Holocene and the previous interglacial period (Eemian) the dust record was dominated by coarse particles consistent with rock samples from central East Greenland. From the coarse particle concentration record we infer the East Greenland ice sheet margin advanced from 113.4 ± 0.4 to 111.0 ± 0.4 ka BP during the glacial onset and retreated from 12.1 ± 0.1 to 9.0 ± 0.1 ka BP during the last deglaciation. These findings constrain the possible response of the Greenland ice sheet to climate forcings.},

The cause of these Heinrich events, as they are commonly known, is not fully understood; however, they may point to surges of the ice stream that drained the Hudson Bay/Hudson Strait region of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. We investigate a simple conceptual model of ice stream instability (the binge/purge model) to suggest ways in which the ice stream could have entrained sufficient debris to account for the estimated mass of IRD associated with a typical Heinrich IRD layer in the North Atlantic (1.0 ± 0.3 × 1015 kg). We find that freezing of debris-laden ice at the bed of the ice stream during the brief (≈ 750 years) surge phase of the ice stream's hypothesized binge/purge cycle can incorporate up to 5.1 × 1015 kg. This amount is sufficient to meet the constraints of the North Atlantic sediment record but by no means verifies the binge/purge model as the cause of Heinrich events.},

	abstract = {Dispersed facies basal ice – massive (i.e. structureless) ice with dispersed debris aggregates – is present at the margins of many glaciers and, as a product of internal glacial processes, has the potential to provide important information about the mechanisms of glacier flow and the nature of the subglacial environment. The origin of dispersed facies is poorly understood, with several hypotheses having been advanced for its formation, and there is disagreement as to whether it is largely a sedimentary or a tectonic feature. We test these established hypotheses at the temperate glacier Svínafellsjökull, Iceland, and find that none fully account for dispersed facies characteristics at this location. Instead, dispersed facies physical, sedimentological and stable-isotope (δ18O, δD) characteristics favour a predominantly tectonic origin that we suggest comprises the regelation and strain-induced metamorphism of debris-rich basal ice that has been entrained into an englacial position by tectonic processes operating at the base of an icefall. Further thickening of the resultant dispersed facies may also occur tectonically as a result of ice flow against the reverse bed slope of a terminal overdeepening. Lack of efficient subglacial drainage in the region of the overdeepening may limit basal melting and thus favour basal ice preservation, including the preservation of dispersed facies. Despite the relatively low sediment content of dispersed facies ( ∼1.6\% by volume), its thickness (up to 25 m) and ubiquity at Svínafellsjökull results in a significant contribution to annual sediment discharge (1635–3270 m3 a−1) that is ∼6.5 times that contributed by debris-rich stratified facies basal ice.},

When the temperature is sufficiently close to that of bulk transition, the surface melts and literally flows as a viscous fluid. This phenomenon, called interfacial premelting, lies at the heart of the microscopic theory of melting of solid matter, and captures the interest of condensed matter physicists and physical chemists alike. The process is ubiquitous and responsible for a wide range of consequences in materials with biological, geophysical, and technological significance. Because such systems are often exposed to spatial or temporal variations in thermodynamic forcing, there are a host of fluid mechanical phenomena that result from this underlying melting behavior. The fluid dynamics of unfrozen surfaces holds clues for understanding the bulk behavior of polycrystalline materials, from Earth's mantle to the stratosphere and beyond. In this review we focus on the fluid dynamical consequences of the premelting of solids.},

	abstract = {, 
Ice-infiltrated sediment, or frozen fringe, is responsible for phenomena such as frost heave, ice lenses and metres of debris-rich ice under glaciers. Understanding frozen fringes is important as frost heave is responsible for damaging infrastructure at high latitudes and sediment freeze-on at the base of glaciers can modulate subglacial friction, influencing the rate of global sea level rise. Here we describe the thermomechanics of liquid water flow and freezing in ice-saturated sediments, focusing on the conditions relevant for subglacial environments. The force balance that governs the frozen fringe thickness depends on the weight of the overlying material, the thermomolecular force between ice and sediments across liquid premelted films and the water pressure required by Darcy flow. We combine this mechanical model with an enthalpy method that conserves energy across phase change interfaces on a fixed computational grid. The force balance and enthalpy model together determine the evolution of the frozen fringe thickness and our simulations predict frost heave rates and ice lens spacing. Our model accounts for premelting at ice–sediment contacts, partial ice saturation of the pore space, water flow through the fringe, the thermodynamics of the ice–water–sediment interface and vertical force balance. We explicitly account for the formation of ice lenses, regions of pure ice that cleave the fringe at the depth where the interparticle force vanishes. Our model results allow us to predict the thickness of a frozen fringe and the spacing of ice lenses in subaerial and subglacial sediments.},

	abstract = {The ice-till interface beneath soft-bedded glaciers can be marked by an abrupt transition from an ice layer above to unfrozen sediments below. Alternatively, the transition can be more gradual, with ice infiltrating the underlying sediments to form a fringe layer that contains a mixture of ice, liquid water, and sediment particles. The fringe thickness h is predicted to commonly be several decimeters to meters in scale, implying that significant sediment transport can occur when sliding occurs beneath. I adapt theories for the thermodynamic and mechanical balances that control freezing and melting in porous media to determine h as a function of effective stress N, the rate of basal heat flow, and key sediment properties. A fringe is expected only when N {\textgreater} pf ≈ 1.1 (Tm − Tf) MPa/°C, where Tm − Tf is the temperature drop below the pressure-melting point that is needed for ice to infiltrate the pore space; pf increases with decreased grain size. For sediment properties that are within the typical range expected of the tills beneath glaciers, pf = O (104) Pa. The rate that water can be transported through the fringe and frozen onto or melted from the glacier base can achieve a steady state that is in balance with the rate that latent heat is transported to or from the basal interface. At constant N, when a gradual increase in heat flow from the glacier base causes the rate of melting to decrease, h increases and continues to do so when the heat flow is great enough to produce freezing. As freezing becomes more rapid and h increases further, the rate of fluid supply to the glacier base reaches a maximum when the effective permeability is sufficiently reduced by the partial ice saturation in the fringe. Larger h can be achieved with slower freezing at the glacier base, but steady states with larger h are unstable. The maximum rate of fluid supply to the glacier base is greater at lower N, higher temperature gradients, and for sediments with higher permeabilities. Unsteady behavior can lead to large changes in h when there is a mismatch between the rate that latent heat can be extracted and the rate that fluid is supplied to the glacier base. Transient behavior driven by abrupt changes in N is characterized by rapid variations in freezing rate, followed by slower adjustments to h that are limited by the timescale for the conduction of latent heat. The resulting patterns of sediment deformation are expected to commonly be distributed over finite depth ranges even when shear is perfectly localized at any single instant in time.},

	abstract = {Anomalous coarse-grained sediment layers beneath the North Atlantic likely originated from sediment freeze-on to the base of ice sheets during the last glacial period. These layers represent periods of extreme ice discharge, called Heinrich events, and are variously attributed to ice stream flow instability, ice shelf collapse, or enhanced terminus melting due to ocean warming. In this paper, we study the processes controlling how sediment freezes on to the base of ice streams and predict the volume of sediment conveyed by icebergs during a Heinrich event. The local thickness of frozen sediment is sensitive to the heat flux at the ice-bed interface and the water pressure, both of which also contribute to the controls on basal friction; as the basal water pressure increases, both the frozen sediment thickness and the basal friction decrease. The sediment discharged during a Heinrich event must have frozen on to the ice during the inter-Heinrich period. As the Heinrich event proceeds, the frozen sediment melts off the base of the ice stream, indicating that the thickness of sediments deposits in the North Atlantic may not reliably constrain Heinrich event duration. Choosing reasonable parameters corresponding to the Hudson Strait Ice Stream, our model of sediment freeze-on and discharge is consistent with observational estimates of Heinrich event sediment discharge volume.},

Glacial erosion rate is usually modelled as a function of glacier sliding velocity, but the empirical basis for this relationship is weak. In turn, climate is assumed to control sliding velocity and hence erosion, but this too lacks empirical scrutiny. Here, we present statistically robust relationships between erosion rates, sliding velocities, and climate from a global compilation of 38 glaciers. We show that sliding is positively and significantly correlated with erosion, and derive a relationship for use in erosion models. Our dataset further demonstrates that the most rapid erosion is achieved at temperate glaciers with high mean annual precipitation, which serve to promote rapid sliding. Precipitation has received little attention in glacial erosion studies, but our data illustrate its importance.},

Therefore, understanding how the production of sediments by glacial erosion has evolved in the past, and will evolve in a changing climate, is increasingly important. In this Review, we examine the processes that control the magnitude and timing of glacial erosion of mountains, and how models can be used to reconstruct processes during the development of mountains. Field observations reveal the important role of sliding on the erosion rate, which provide an empirical basis to explain the glacial buzzsaw and the impact of late Cenozoic cooling on erosion rates. Glacial erosion is also expected to evolve in the context of anthropogenic climate warming, as both glacier sliding and the input of meltwater related to thinning and retreat of ice will change, with large effects on downstream ecosystems and global biogeochemical cycles. Thus, the mechanics and impacts of glaciers on sediment production warrant more research, especially in regions experiencing rapid warming. Above all, there is a need for better monitoring of how erosion rates changed over the last decades and will evolve in the future.},

 land-terminating glaciers is far larger than 43, but we lump them into
 larger units for simplification. Each glacier catchment is defined using a
 combination of ice flow direction and surface slope. In areas of fast flow

	abstract = {We present a 1986 through March 2020 estimate of Greenland Ice Sheet ice discharge. Our data include all discharging ice that flows faster than 100\&thinsp;m\&thinsp;yr−1 and are generated through an automatic and adaptable method, as opposed to conventional handpicked gates. We position gates near the present-year termini and estimate problematic bed topography (ice thickness) values where necessary. In addition to using annual time-varying ice thickness, our time series uses velocity maps that begin with sparse spatial and temporal coverage and end with near-complete spatial coverage and 12\&thinsp;d updates to velocity. The 2010 through 2019 average ice discharge through the flux gates is ∼487±49\&thinsp;Gt\&thinsp;yr−1. The 10\&thinsp;\% uncertainty stems primarily from uncertain ice bed location (ice thickness). We attribute the ∼50\&thinsp;Gt\&thinsp;yr−1 differences among our results and previous studies to our use of updated bed topography from BedMachine v3. Discharge is approximately steady from 1986 to 2000, increases sharply from 2000 to 2005, and then is approximately steady again. However, regional and glacier variability is more pronounced, with recent decreases at most major glaciers and in all but one region offset by increases in the northwest region through 2017 and in the southeast from 2017 through March 2020.

	abstract = {Petermann Fjord is a deep (\&gt;1000\&thinsp;m) fjord that incises the coastline of north-west Greenland and was carved by an expanded Petermann Glacier, one of the six largest outlet glaciers draining the modern Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). Between 5 and 70\&thinsp;m of unconsolidated glacigenic material infills in the fjord and adjacent Nares Strait, deposited as the Petermann and Nares Strait ice streams retreated through the area after the Last Glacial Maximum. We have investigated the deglacial deposits using seismic stratigraphic techniques and have correlated our results with high-resolution bathymetric data and core lithofacies. We identify six seismo-acoustic facies in more than 3500 line kilometres of sub-bottom and seismic-reflection profiles throughout the fjord, Hall Basin and Kennedy Channel. Seismo-acoustic facies relate to bedrock or till surfaces (Facies I), subglacial deposition (Facies II), deposition from meltwater plumes and icebergs in quiescent glacimarine conditions (Facies III, IV), deposition at grounded ice margins during stillstands in retreat (grounding-zone wedges; Facies V) and the redeposition of material downslope (Facies IV). These sediment units represent the total volume of glacial sediment delivered to the mapped marine environment during retreat. We calculate a glacial sediment flux for the former Petermann ice stream as 1080–1420\&thinsp;m3\&thinsp;a−1 per metre of ice stream width and an average deglacial erosion rate for the basin of 0.29–0.34\&thinsp;mm\&thinsp;a−1. Our deglacial erosion rates are consistent with results from Antarctic Peninsula fjord systems but are several times lower than values for other modern GrIS catchments. This difference is attributed to fact that large volumes of surface water do not access the bed in the Petermann system, and we conclude that glacial erosion is limited to areas overridden by streaming ice in this large outlet glacier setting. Erosion rates are also presented for two phases of ice retreat and confirm that there is significant variation in rates over a glacial–deglacial transition. Our new glacial sediment fluxes and erosion rates show that the Petermann ice stream was approximately as efficient as the palaeo-Jakobshavn Isbræ at eroding, transporting and delivering sediment to its margin during early deglaciation.},

Attention herein is directed at sediment yields, including both overall bedrock erosion and evacuation of sediments stored in glaciated basins over several years or decades. These yields, expressed as effective rates of glacial erosion, vary by orders of magnitude from 0.01 mm yr−1 for polar glaciers and thin temperate plateau glaciers on crystalline bedrock, to 0.1 mm yr−1 for temperate valley glaciers also on resistant crystalline bedrock in Norway, to 1.0 mm yr−1 for small temperate glaciers on diverse bedrock in the Swiss Alps, and to 10–100 mm yr−1 for large and fast-moving temperate valley glaciers in the tectonically active ranges of southeast Alaska. In Alaska, current sediment yields generally increase with the extent of glacial ice cover, and are particularly high in the large heavily-glaciated basins of southern Alaska, where they exceed those of basins from other regions by about one order of magnitude. These results, supported by comparisons of sediment yields between glaciated and nonglaciated basins in Alaska, Norway and Iceland, suggest that climatic conditions favorable for the expansion of temperate valley glaciers tend to increase both mechanical and chemical denudation rates. The results are discussed in the broader context of linking erosion and climate during the ice ages of the Quaternary, and interpreting records of sedimentation from glaciated regions.},

Much uncertainty remains in the future mass loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet due to the challenges of capturing the ice dynamic response to climate change in numerical models. Here, we estimate the sea level contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet over the 21st century using an ice-sheet wide, high-resolution, ice-ocean numerical model that includes surface mass balance forcing, thermal forcing from the ocean, and iceberg calving dynamics. The model is calibrated with ice front observations from the past eleven years to capture the recent evolution of marine-terminating glaciers. Under a business as usual scenario, we find that northwest and central west Greenland glaciers will contribute more mass loss than other regions due to ice front retreat and ice flow acceleration. By the end of century, ice discharge from marine-terminating glaciers will contribute 50 ± 20\% of the total mass loss, or twice as much as previously estimated although the contribution from the surface mass balance increases towards the end of the century.},

Here we combine more than three decades of remotely sensed observational products of outlet glacier velocity, elevation, and front position changes over the full ice sheet. We compare decadal variability in discharge and calving front position and find that increased glacier discharge was due almost entirely to the retreat of glacier fronts, rather than inland ice sheet processes, with a remarkably consistent speedup of 4–5\% per km of retreat across the ice sheet. We show that widespread retreat between 2000 and 2005 resulted in a step-increase in discharge and a switch to a new dynamic state of sustained mass loss that would persist even under a decline in surface melt.},

Christian Schoof uses a physically based model that captures drainage channelization under the ice to challenge this view. The model shows that increased melt supply leads to channelization and a drop in water pressure. This causes ice flow to slow down rather than speed up. However, this effect can be overcome if melt supply is variable over short timescales, when temporary pressure spikes can lead to accelerated flow. The positive melt/dynamic thinning feedback is therefore still viable, but is heavily dependent on daily temperature variations and rain events that are largely ignored in current ice sheet models.},

	abstract = {We present a two-dimensional Glacier Drainage System model (GlaDS) that couples distributed and channelized subglacial water flow. Distributed flow occurs through linked cavities that are represented as a continuous water sheet of variable thickness. Channelized flow occurs through Röthlisberger channels that can form on any of the edges of a prescribed, unstructured network of potential channels. Water storage is accounted for in an englacial aquifer and in moulins, which also act as point sources of water to the subglacial system. Solutions are presented for a synthetic topography designed to mimic an ice sheet margin. For low discharge, all the flow is accommodated in the sheet, whereas for sufficiently high discharge, the model exhibits a channelization instability which leads to the formation of a self-organized channel system. The random orientation of the network edges allows the channel system geometry to be relatively unbiased, in contrast to previous structured grid-based models. Under steady conditions, the model supports the classical view of the subglacial drainage system, with low pressure regions forming around the channels. Under diurnally varying input, water flows in and out of the channels, and a rather complex spatiotemporal pattern of water pressures is predicted. We explore the effects of parameter variations on the channel system topology and mean effective pressure. The model is then applied to a mountain glacier and forced with meltwater calculated by a temperature index model. The results are broadly consistent with our current understanding of the glacier drainage system and demonstrate the applicability of the model to real settings.},

	abstract = {Subglacial hydrology has a strong influence on glacier and ice sheet dynamics, particularly through the dependence of sliding velocity on subglacial water pressure. Significant challenges are involved in modeling subglacial hydrology, as the drainage geometry and flow mechanics are constantly changing, with complex feedbacks that play out between water and ice. A clear tradition has been established in the subglacial hydrology modeling literature of distinguishing between channelized (efficient) and sheetlike (inefficient or distributed) drainage systems or components and using slightly different forms of the governing equations in each subsystem to represent the dominant physics. Specifically, many previous subglacial hydrology models disregard opening by melt in the sheetlike system or redistribute it to adjacent channel elements in order to avoid runaway growth that occurs when it is included in the sheetlike system. We present a new subglacial hydrology model, SHAKTI (Subglacial Hydrology and Kinetic, Transient Interactions), in which a single set of governing equations is used everywhere, including opening by melt in the entire domain. SHAKTI employs a generalized relationship between the subglacial water flux and the hydraulic gradient that allows for the representation of laminar, turbulent, and transitional regimes depending on the local Reynolds number. This formulation allows for the coexistence of these flow regimes in different regions, and the configuration and geometry of the subglacial system evolves naturally to represent sheetlike drainage as well as systematic channelized drainage under appropriate conditions. We present steady and transient example simulations to illustrate the features and capabilities of the model and to examine sensitivity to mesh size and time step size. The model is implemented as part of the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM).},

	abstract = {In order to further develop 238U-234U-230Th disequilibria techniques for dating polar ice, we measured these nuclides by mass spectrometric methods for silty ice samples from the base of the GISP2 central Greenland ice core. We separated the samples by filtration and analyzed the {\textless}50 nm (truly dissolved + particulate) and {\textgreater}200 nm (particulate) filtered fractions. 230Th/234U activity ratios are quite low in the {\textless}50 nm fraction (0.18-0.24), and since natural liquid water is characterized by 230Th/234U activity ratios ≪1, these results suggest that recent melting/freezing event(s) have occurred at the base of the GISP2 core. The particulate fraction is characterized by 230Th/234U activity ratios of 1.12-1.23 which are also consistent with recent ({\textless}380 ka) fractionation of thorium from uranium in these ice samples. We have modeled these results using a two component mass balance calculation, with dissolved and particulate pools for each radionuclide. Although the model results vary slightly depending on assumptions, corrected dates for when the samples were last frozen range from 3500-8300 years ago, with typical 2σ uncertainties of 600-2300 years. These results are generally consistent with other geochemical and chronological data for Greenland ice cores and the notion of ice melting at the base of large continental ice sheets, even in areas that are currently frozen. Based on our U-series results and gas data in the literature, prior melting of the GISP2 ice core has evidently occurred for most of the 13 m thick silty basal layer but is most pronounced for the deepest 2 m. We also suggest that this new 230Th ingrowth method for dating previously melted ice may be more generally applicable to samples with a range of particulate matter concentrations.},

	abstract = {We present a synchronization of the NGRIP, GRIP and GISP2 ice cores onto a master chronology extending back to 104 ka before present, providing a consistent chronological framework for these three Greenland records. The synchronization aligns distinct peaks in volcanic proxy records and other impurity records (chemo-stratigraphic matching) and assumes that these layers of elevated impurity content represent the same, instantaneous event in the past at all three sites. More than 900 marker horizons between the three cores have been identified and our matching is independently confirmed by 24 new and previously identified volcanic ash (tephra) tie-points. Using the reference horizons, we transfer the widely used Greenland ice-core chronology, GICC05modelext, to the two Summit cores, GRIP and GISP2. Furthermore, we provide gas chronologies for the Summit cores that are consistent with the GICC05modelext timescale by utilizing both existing and new gas data (CH4 concentration and δ15N of N2). We infer that the accumulation contrast between the stadial and interstadial phases of the glacial period was ∼10\% greater at Summit compared to at NGRIP. The δ18O temperature-proxy records from NGRIP, GRIP, and GISP2 are generally very similar and display synchronous behaviour at climate transitions. The δ18O differences between Summit and NGRIP, however, changed slowly over the Last Glacial–Interglacial cycle and also underwent abrupt millennial-to-centennial-scale variations. We suggest that this observed latitudinal δ18O gradient in Greenland during the glacial period is the result of 1) relatively higher degree of precipitation with a Pacific signature at NGRIP, 2) increased summer bias in precipitation at Summit, and 3) enhanced Rayleigh distillation due to an increased source-to-site distance and a potentially larger source-to-site temperature gradient. We propose that these processes are governed by changes in the North American Ice Sheet (NAIS) volume and North Atlantic sea-ice extent and/or sea-surface temperatures (SST) on orbital timescales, and that changing sea-ice extent and SSTs are the driving mechanisms on shorter timescales. Finally, we observe that maxima in the Summit–NGRIP δ18O difference are roughly coincident with prominent Heinrich events. This suggests that the climatic reorganization that takes place during stadials with Heinrich events, possibly driven by a southward expansion of sea ice and low SSTs in the North Atlantic, are recorded in the ice-core records.},

	abstract = {Wire regelation is a common tabletop demonstration of the pressure-dependence of the ice melting temperature where a loaded wire moves from top to bottom through a block of ice, yet leaves the block intact. With the background temperature fixed at the bulk melting point ∼0°C, the elevated ice and liquid pressures beneath the wire cause melting because of the negative Clapeyron slope, while refreezing takes place above the wire where the pressures are reduced. Regelation is a model for temperate glacier ice moving through small bedrock obstacles. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that regelation continues to occur, albeit at much slower velocities, when the fixed background ice temperature is cold enough that the wire load is insufficient to produce bulk melting, suggesting that premelting plays a central role. Here, we compile available data for wire regelation at all temperatures. We then develop a model for the subtemperate data points, where the film thickness depends on the temperature below the melting point. We find agreement between the power-law model and the laboratory data for slow regelation velocities, allowing us to characterize the dominant premelting mechanisms for different wire compositions. These results advance our understanding of the role of premelting in subtemperate glacier sliding.},

Our reconstructed ages for basal ice samples are based on comparison of published measurements of CH4 and δ18Oatm from the disturbed section of the GRIP and GISP2 cores with the same properties in the Vostok ice core. NGRIP δ18Oice values are also used to constrain the chronology during the end of marine isotope stage 5e. For each sample, we assign an age that represents the unique or most probable time of gas trapping, given its gas composition. Of 157 samples with CH4 and δ18Oatm data, 10 give unique ages. Twenty-five newly measured values of the triple isotope composition of O2 from the disturbed section of the GISP2 core add a third time-dependent gas property that agrees with our reconstruction. Our reconstruction supports earlier conclusions of Landais et al. (2003) that the disturbed section primarily includes ice from the last interglacial (MIS 5e) and the penultimate glacial period (MIS 6). The oldest ice in the basal layer of GISP2 and GRIP has an age ≥237 ka. The climate history we derive suggests that the last interglacial at Summit, Greenland, around 127 ka was slightly warmer than the current interglacial period. Reduction of various ion concentrations in ice and thickening of the ice sheet during Termination II was similar to that in Termination I.},

We also present data for the abundance and isotopic composition of O2 and N2, and abundance of Ar, in the basal dirty ice. The Ar/N2 ratio of dirty basal ice, the heavy isotope enrichment (reflecting gravitational fractionation), and the total gas content all indicate that the gases in basal dirty ice originate from the assimilation of clean ice of the overlying glacier, which comprises most of the ice in the dirty bottom layer. O2 is partly to completely depleted in basal ice, reflecting active metabolism. The gravitationally corrected ratio of 40Ar/38Ar, which decreases with age in the global atmosphere, is compatible with an age of 100–250ka for clean disturbed ice. In basal ice, 40Ar is present in excess due to injection of radiogenic 40Ar produced in the underlying continental crust. The weak depth gradient of 40Ar in the dirty basal ice, and the distribution of dirt, indicate mixing within the basal ice, while various published lines of evidence indicate mixing within the overlying clean, disturbed ice. Excess CH4, which reaches thousands of ppm in basal dirty ice at GRIP, is virtually absent in overlying clean disturbed ice, demonstrating that mixing of dirty basal ice into the overlying clean ice, if it occurs at all, is very slow. Order-of-magnitude estimates indicate that the mixing rate of clean ice into dirty ice is sufficient to maintain a steady thickness of dirty ice against thinning from the mean ice flow. The dirty ice appears to consist of two or more basal components in addition to clean glacial ice. A small amount of soil or permafrost, plus preglacial snow, lake or ground ice could explain the observations.},

We have constructed and begun using a custom, falling-head permeameter for measuring the permeability of temperate, polycrystalline ice. Chilled water is passed through an ice disk that is kept at the pressure-melting temperature while the rate of head decrease indicates the permeability. Fluorescein dye in the water allows water-vein geometry to be studied using fluorescence microscopy. Water flow over durations of seconds to hours is Darcian, and for grain diameter d increasing from 1.7 to 8.9 mm, average permeability decreases from 2 × 10−12 to 4 × 10−15 m2. In tests with dye on fine (d = 2 mm) and coarse (d = 7 mm) ice, average area-weighted vein radii are nearly equal, 41 and 34 μm, respectively. These average radii, if included in a theory slightly modified from Nye and Frank (1973), yield permeability values within a factor of 2.0 of best-fit values based on regression of the data. Permeability values depend on d−3.4, rather than d−2 as predicted by models if vein radii are considered independent of d. In future experiments, the dependence of permeability on liquid water content will be measured.},

	abstract = {Successful core-drilling to bedrock of both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets offers unique opportunities for examining processes acting at the bed. At Byrd Station, Antarctica, penetration of the bed was accompanied by upwelling of glacial meltwater into the drillhole. The nature and disposition of sediment in the 4.83 m thick debris-rich basal ice, together with stable-isotope and gas analyses of the enclosing ice, confirm that incorporation of the debris occurred simultaneously with periodic “freeze-on” of basal meltwater. Currently, the presence of substantial meltwater at the ice/rock interface likely precludes any erosive activity at the bed. At GISP2, Greenland, basal silly ice, 13.1 m thick, is currently frozen to the bed at −9° C. Limited studies of the silty ice at GISP 2, together with results of more comprehensive investigations obtained by GRIP researchers on basal ice at a companion site at Summit indicate that the sediment-bearing basal ice likely formed in the absence of an ice sheet and was therefore unrelated to direct interaction of the present ice sheet with its bed. The fact that the basal ice at Summit is frozen to the bottom also precludes any likelihood of erosive activity at the bed.},

However, it has inherent limitations, requiring isotropic solid stresses and conditions near bulk equilibrium. Here, we examine when the Clapeyron equation is applicable by providing a rigorous derivation that details all assumptions. We demonstrate the natural extension for anisotropic stress states, and we show how the temperature and pressure ranges for validity depend on well-defined material properties. Finally, we demonstrate how the range of applicability of the (linear) Clapeyron equation can be extended by adding higher-order terms, yielding results that are in good agreement with experimental data for the pressure melting of ice.},

A similar effect is likely during water freezing since diffusion coefficients of HDO and H218O are also different in liquid water. Their values are however less different from each other than those in air. Therefore, such a kinetic isotope effect during water freezing is less frequently observed in Nature. This paper describes a situation in Antarctica where this effect is conspicuous in icings (aufeis). In this type of ice indeed there is no relationship between δD (or δ18O) and deuterium excess whereas a clear inverse relationship between these parameters exists in ice formed by water freezing when equilibrium isotopic fractionation applies. This kinetic effect is potentially present in hail within clouds, in infiltration ice (formed during sea ice growth) and in some kinds of ground ice.},

Important results are: that the temperature increase from average glacial to Holocene conditions was large, approximately 15°C, with a 20°C warming from late glacial to Holocene; that the average accumulation rate during the last glacial maximum (between 15 and 30 kyr B. P.) was 5.5 to 7 cm yr−1, approximately 25\% of the modern accumulation rate; that long-term (500–1000 years) averaged accumulation rate and temperature have been inversely correlated during the most recent 7 millennia of the Holocene; and that the Greenland Ice Sheet probably thickened during the deglacial transition. The inverse correlation of accumulation rate and temperature in the mid and late Holocene suggests that the Greenland Ice Sheet is more prone to volume reduction in a warmed climate than previously thought and demonstrates that accumulation rate is not a reliable proxy for temperature. The elevation history of the ice sheet is poorly constrained by the model, and independent evidence is needed. We also present a simple estimate of the response time for thinning of the interior region of an ice sheet due to retreat of its margins.

It is shown that the vein cross-section can be constructed, given the three widths of a vein and one of the dihedral angles, providing that the radius of curvature around the vein wallsrv is a constant. This assumption can be checked if the values of at least two of the dihedral angles associated with the vein cross-section are known. Ifrv is a constant, then the solid-liquid interfacial energy ϒsl must be isotropic for the veins in question and any deviations from uniform equilibrium geometry must derive primarily from anisotropy in the grain-boundary energy ϒss. The cross-sections of three veins that meet in a particular node are constructed. The assumption of isotropic ϒsl is found to hold for this node.},

Together with previously measured and mostly published δ15N data, we present for the ﬁrst time a NGRIP temperature reconstruction for the whole last glacial period from 10 to 120 kyr b2k (thousand years before 2000 AD) including every DO event based on δ15N isotope measurements combined with a ﬁrn densiﬁcation and heat diffusion model. The detected temperature rises at the onset of DO events range from 5 ◦C (DO 25) up to 16.5 ◦C (DO 11) with an uncertainty of ±3 ◦C. To bring measured and modelled data into agreement, we had to reduce the accumulation rate given by the NGRIP ss09sea06bm timescale in some periods by 30 to 35 \%, especially during the last glacial maximum. A comparison between reconstructed temperature and δ18Oice data conﬁrms that the isotopic composition of the stadial was strongly inﬂuenced by seasonality. We evidence an anticorrelation between the variations of the δ18Oice sensitivity to temperature (referred to as α) and obliquity in agreement with a simple Rayleigh distillation model. Finally, we suggest that α might be inﬂuenced by the Northern Hemisphere ice sheet volume.},

Although measurements performed on the first ice cores, Camp Century and Byrd, largely focused on the isotopic composition of the ice as an indicator of climate change, the number of studied parameters has steadily increased encompassing numerous measurements performed on the entrapped air bubbles, on various impurities as well as on the ice itself. The climatic information provided by these various paleodata time is extremely rich. The relationships between forcing factors and climate, about the importance of carbon cycle feedbacks, about the occurrence of abrupt climate variability, and about the interplay between polar climate, ice sheet dynamics, and sea-level variations are examples that are highly relevant to future climate change.

A detailed study of the δ cycles in the Wisconsin glaciation show that they cannot be ascribed to discontinuities in the cores, nor to ice-dynamic instabilities in the ice sheet. In the Holocene, the δ cycles are less pronounced, but they are concurrent with the fluctuating glacier extention elsewhere, which substantiates their climatic significance. An anti-correlation with 14C concentration in atmospheric CO2, and with 10Be deposition rates on the ice sheets, suggests a connection between climate and solar processes, but a conclusion on this point must await clarification of the terrestrial circulation and mixing processes, and the relationship between the solar outputs of radiation and particulate matter.},

The response of the Greenland ice sheet to the warmer-than-present climate of the Eemian has thus remained unclear. Here we present the new North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling (‘NEEM’) ice core and show only a modest ice-sheet response to the strong warming in the early Eemian. We reconstructed the Eemian record from folded ice using globally homogeneous parameters known from dated Greenland and Antarctic ice-core records. On the basis of water stable isotopes, NEEM surface temperatures after the onset of the Eemian (126,000 years ago) peaked at 8 ± 4 degrees Celsius above the mean of the past millennium, followed by a gradual cooling that was probably driven by the decreasing summer insolation. Between 128,000 and 122,000 years ago, the thickness of the northwest Greenland ice sheet decreased by 400 ± 250 metres, reaching surface elevations 122,000 years ago of 130 ± 300 metres lower than the present. Extensive surface melt occurred at the NEEM site during the Eemian, a phenomenon witnessed when melt layers formed again at NEEM during the exceptional heat of July 2012. With additional warming, surface melt might become more common in the future.},

Here, we present improved Eemian climate records from central Greenland, reconstructed from the base of the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) ice core. Our record comes from clean, stratigraphically disturbed, and isotopically warm ice from 2,750 to 3,040 m depth. The age of this ice is constrained by measuring CH4 and δ18O of O2, and comparing with the historical record of these properties from the North Greenland Ice Core Project (NGRIP) and North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling (NEEM) ice cores. The δ18Oice, δ15N of N2, and total air content for samples dating discontinuously from 128 to 115 ka indicate a warming of ∼6 °C between 127–121 ka, and a similar elevation history between GISP2 and NEEM. The reconstructed climate and elevation histories are compared with an ensemble of coupled climate-ice-sheet model simulations of the Greenland ice sheet. Those most consistent with the reconstructed temperatures indicate that the Greenland ice sheet contributed 5.1 m (4.1–6.2 m, 95\% credible interval) to global eustatic sea level toward the end of the Eemian. Greenland likely did not contribute to anomalously high sea levels at ∼127 ka, or to a rapid jump in sea level at ∼120 ka. However, several unexplained discrepancies remain between the inferred and simulated histories of temperature and accumulation rate at GISP2 and NEEM, as well as between the climatic reconstructions themselves.},

Here we present the complete oxygen isotope record for the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) core, drilled 28 km west of the GRIP core. We observe large, rapid climate fluctuations throughout the last glacial period, which closely match those reported for the GRIP core. However, in the bottom 10\% of the cores, spanning the Eemian interglacial and the previous glacia-tion, there are significant differences between the two records. It is possible that ice flow may have altered the chronological sequences of the stratigraphy for the bottom part of one or both of the cores. Considerable further work will be necessary to evaluate the likelihood of this, and the extent to which it will still be possible to extract meaningful climate information from the lowest sections of the cores.},

A major process of basal silty ice formation in the central part of Greenland is incorporation of relict non-glacial ice at the base of the ice sheet during its development. The evidence for this can be found in a stable isotope composition study, both in δD and δ18O, in a total gas content and gas composition study, in a comparison of the dielectric conductivity profile and chemical profiles. Ice crystallographic investigations and the study of the isotopic compositions in Nd, Sr and Pb of the mineral particles embedded in the silty ice help to clarify the situation.
The processes proposed to explain the stacked sequence developed in the basal silty ice of these central areas are folding resulting in the interbedding of silty ice and glacial ice, and flow-induced mixing related to circular motion of ice in bedrock depressions with flow separation accompanied by some entrainment of the underlying ice.},

By the end of the next century, a 3–5 °C warming is expected in Greenland. Similar temperatures in this region were reached during the last interglacial (LIG) period, 130–115 ka BP, due to a change in orbital configuration rather than to an anthropogenic forcing. Ice core evidence suggests that the Greenland ice sheet (GIS) survived this warm period, but great uncertainties remain about the total Greenland ice reduction during the LIG. Here we perform long-term simulations of the GIS using an improved ice sheet model. Both the methodologies chosen to reconstruct palaeoclimate and to calibrate the model are strongly based on proxy data. We suggest a relatively low contribution to LIG sea level rise from Greenland melting, ranging from 0.7 to 1.5 m of sea level equivalent, contrasting with previous studies. Our results suggest an important contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet to the LIG highstand.},

Meteoric 10Be data and grain features indicate that the ice sheet interacted with paleosols and eroded fresh bedrock, leading to mixing in these debris-rich ice layers. Our analysis also identifies four successive stages in NW Greenland: (1) initial preglacial conditions, (2) glacial advance 1, (3) glacial retreat and interglacial conditions and (4) glacial advance 2 (current ice-sheet development). C/N and δ13C data suggest that deglacial environments favored the development of tundra and taiga ecosystems. These two successive glacial fluctuations observed at NEEM are consistent with those identified from the Camp Century core basal sediments over the last 3 Ma. Further inland, GRIP and GISP2 summit sites have remained glaciated more continuously than the western margin, with less intense ice-substratum interactions than those observed at NEEM.},

By incorporating realistic geostatistically simulated topography, we show that a spatially highly variable layer of temperate ice (much softer ice at the pressure-melting point) forms naturally in both settings, alongside ice motion patterns which diverge substantially from those obtained using smoothly varying BedMachine topography. Temperate ice is vertically extensive ({\textgreater}100 meters) in deep troughs but thins notably ({\textless}5 meters) over bedrock highs, with basal slip rates reaching {\textgreater}90 or {\textless}5\% of surface velocity dependent on topography and temperate layer thickness.

Here, we expand upon past work using the Ice Sheet System Model to quantify the uncertainties in models of the ice flow in the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream by perturbing the geothermal heat flux. Utilizing a subglacial hydrology model simulating sliding beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet, we investigate the sensitivity of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream ice flow to various estimates of geothermal heat flux, and implications of basal heat flux uncertainties on modeling the hydrological processes beneath Greenland's major ice stream. We find that the uncertainty due to sliding at the bed is 10 times greater than the uncertainty associated with internal ice viscosity. Geothermal heat flux dictates the size of the area of the subglacial drainage system and its efficiency. The uncertainty of ice discharge from the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream to the ocean due to uncertainties in the geothermal heat flux is estimated at 2.10 Gt/yr. This highlights the urgency in obtaining better constraints on the highly uncertain subglacial hydrology parameters.},

	abstract = {The Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) is out of equilibrium with the current anthropogenic-enhanced climate forcing. Paleoenvironmental records and ice sheet models reveal that the AIS has been tightly coupled to the climate system during the past and indicate the potential for accelerated and sustained Antarctic ice mass loss into the future. Modern observations by contrast suggest that the AIS has only just started to respond to climate change in recent decades. The maximum projected sea level contribution from Antarctica to 2100 has increased significantly since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5th Assessment Report, although estimates continue to evolve with new observational and theoretical advances. This review brings together recent literature highlighting the progress made on the known processes and feedbacks that influence the stability of the AIS. Reducing the uncertainty in the magnitude and timing of the future sea level response to AIS change requires a multidisciplinary approach that integrates knowledge of the interactions between the ice sheet, solid Earth, atmosphere, and ocean systems and across time scales of days to millennia. We start by reviewing the processes affecting AIS mass change, from atmospheric and oceanic processes acting on short time scales (days to decades), through to ice processes acting on intermediate time scales (decades to centuries) and the response to solid Earth interactions over longer time scales (decades to millennia). We then review the evidence of AIS changes from the Pliocene to the present and consider the projections of global sea level rise and their consequences. We highlight priority research areas required to improve our understanding of the processes and feedbacks governing AIS change.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The last interglacial period (LIG, ∼ 129–116 thousand years ago) provides the most recent case study of multimillennial polar warming above the preindustrial level and a response of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to this warming, as well as a test bed for climate and ice sheet models. Past changes in Greenland ice sheet thickness and surface temperature during this period were recently derived from the North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling (NEEM) ice core records, northwest Greenland. The NEEM paradox has emerged from an estimated large local warming above the preindustrial level (7.5 ± 1.8 °C at the deposition site 126 kyr ago without correction for any overall ice sheet altitude changes between the LIG and the preindustrial period) based on water isotopes, together with limited local ice thinning, suggesting more resilience of the real Greenland ice sheet than shown in some ice sheet models. Here, we provide an independent assessment of the average LIG Greenland surface warming using ice core air isotopic composition (δ15N) and relationships between accumulation rate and temperature. The LIG surface temperature at the upstream NEEM deposition site without ice sheet altitude correction is estimated to be warmer by +8.5 ± 2.5 °C compared to the preindustrial period. This temperature estimate is consistent with the 7.5 ± 1.8 °C warming initially determined from NEEM water isotopes but at the upper end of the preindustrial period to LIG temperature difference of +5.2 ± 2.3 °C obtained at the NGRIP (North Greenland Ice Core Project) site by the same method. Climate simulations performed with present-day ice sheet topography lead in general to a warming smaller than reconstructed, but sensitivity tests show that larger amplitudes (up to 5 °C) are produced in response to prescribed changes in sea ice extent and ice sheet topography.},

The response of the Greenland ice sheet to the warmer-than-present climate of the Eemian has thus remained unclear. Here we present the new North Greenland Eemian Ice Drilling (‘NEEM’) ice core and show only a modest ice-sheet response to the strong warming in the early Eemian. We reconstructed the Eemian record from folded ice using globally homogeneous parameters known from dated Greenland and Antarctic ice-core records. On the basis of water stable isotopes, NEEM surface temperatures after the onset of the Eemian (126,000 years ago) peaked at 8 ± 4 degrees Celsius above the mean of the past millennium, followed by a gradual cooling that was probably driven by the decreasing summer insolation. Between 128,000 and 122,000 years ago, the thickness of the northwest Greenland ice sheet decreased by 400 ± 250 metres, reaching surface elevations 122,000 years ago of 130 ± 300 metres lower than the present. Extensive surface melt occurred at the NEEM site during the Eemian, a phenomenon witnessed when melt layers formed again at NEEM during the exceptional heat of July 2012. With additional warming, surface melt might become more common in the future.},

	abstract = {Substantial data sets have been collected on the relaxation characteristics, density, grain size, c axis fabrics, and ultrasonic velocities of the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 (GISP2) core to its contact with bedrock at 3053.4 m. Changes in all these properties paralleled closely those found in cores from Byrd Station, Antarctica, and Dye 3, Greenland. Density increased progressively with depth to a maximum of 0.921 Mg/m3 at about 1400 m, at which depth the ice became bubble free. Below about 2000 m, in situ densities began to decrease in response to increasing ice sheet temperatures. Since drilling, much of the ice core has undergone significant volume expansion (relaxation) due to microcracking and the exsolving of enclathratized gases, especially in the brittle ice zone between 650 and 1400 m. Grain size increased linearly to about 1000 m, thereafter remaining fairly constant until the Younger Dryas event at 1678 m where a twofold to threefold decrease in grain size occurred. These grain size changes were accompanied by a progressive clustering of crystal c axes toward the vertical, including a small increase in c axis concentration across the Younger Dryas/Holocene boundary. Increased dust levels in the Wisconsin ice have contributed to the maintenance of a fine-grained texture which, with its strong vertical c axis fabric, persisted to nearly 3000 m. However, beginning at about 2800 m, layers of coarse-grained ice intermixed with the much finer-grained matrix ice are observed. Below 3000 m the ice became very coarse grained. This change, attributed to annealing recrystallization at elevated temperatures in the ice sheet, was accompanied by a dispersed or ring-like redistribution of the c axes about the vertical. Ultrasonic measurements of vertical and horizontal P wave velocities made at 10-m intervals along the entire length of the GISP2 core fully confirmed the results of the crystallo-optical observations. A return to fine-grained ice coincided with the first appearance of brown, silty ice 13 m above bedrock. Bedrock material consisted of 48 cm of till, including boulders and cobbles, overlying gray biotite granite comprising the true bedrock. There is evidence that disturbed structure in the GISP2 cores begins little more than 70\% of the way through the ice sheet. This disturbance increases with depth until it becomes large enough to cast suspicion on features lasting centuries or more in the bottom 10\% of the ice sheet.},

At Byrd Station, Antarctica, penetration of the bed was accompanied by upwelling of glacial meltwater into the drillhole. The nature and disposition of sediment in the 4.83 m thick debris-rich basal ice, together with stable-isotope and gas analyses of the enclosing ice, confirm that incorporation of the debris occurred simultaneously with periodic “freeze-on” of basal meltwater. Currently, the presence of substantial meltwater at the ice/rock interface likely precludes any erosive activity at the bed. At GISP2, Greenland, basal silly ice, 13.1 m thick, is currently frozen to the bed at −9° C. Limited studies of the silty ice at GISP 2, together with results of more comprehensive investigations obtained by GRIP researchers on basal ice at a companion site at Summit indicate that the sediment-bearing basal ice likely formed in the absence of an ice sheet and was therefore unrelated to direct interaction of the present ice sheet with its bed. The fact that the basal ice at Summit is frozen to the bottom also precludes any likelihood of erosive activity at the bed.},

	abstract = {Understanding the history of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is critical for determining its sensitivity to warming and contribution to sea level; however, that history is poorly known before the last interglacial. Most knowledge comes from interpretation of marine sediment, an indirect record of past ice-sheet extent and behavior. Subglacial sediment and rock, retrieved at the base of ice cores, provide terrestrial evidence for GrIS behavior during the Pleistocene. Here, we use multiple methods to determine GrIS history from subglacial sediment at the base of the Camp Century ice core collected in 1966. This material contains a stratigraphic record of glaciation and vegetation in northwestern Greenland spanning the Pleistocene. Enriched stable isotopes of pore-ice suggest precipitation at lower elevations implying ice-sheet absence. Plant macrofossils and biomarkers in the sediment indicate that paleo-ecosystems from previous interglacial periods are preserved beneath the GrIS. Cosmogenic 26Al/10Be and luminescence data bracket the burial of the lower-most sediment between {\textless}3.2 ± 0.4 Ma and {\textgreater}0.7 to 1.4 Ma. In the upper-most sediment, cosmogenic 26Al/10Be data require exposure within the last 1.0 ± 0.1 My. The unique subglacial sedimentary record from Camp Century documents at least two episodes of ice-free, vegetated conditions, each followed by glaciation. The lower sediment derives from an Early Pleistocene GrIS advance. 26Al/10Be ratios in the upper-most sediment match those in subglacial bedrock from central Greenland, suggesting similar ice-cover histories across the GrIS. We conclude that the GrIS persisted through much of the Pleistocene but melted and reformed at least once since 1.1 Ma.},

	abstract = {Medial moraines form striking dark stripes that widen non-linearly, steepen laterally and increase in relief down-glacier from the equilibrium line. Coalescence of these low-ablation-rate features can feed back strongly on the mass balance of a glacier snout. Ablation-dominated medial moraines originate from debris delivered to glacier margins, producing a debris-rich septum between tributary streams of ice below their confluence. Emergence of this ice below the equilibrium line delivers debris to the glacier surface, which then moves down local slopes of evolving morainal topography. A quantitative description of moraine evolution requires specification of the debris concentration field within the glacier, treatment of the melt-rate dependence on debris thickness, and characterization of processes that transport debris once it emerges onto the ice surface. Debris concentration at glacier tributary junctions scales with the erosion rates and the lengths of the tributary-valley walls, and inversely with the tributary ice speeds. Melt rate is damped exponentially by debris, with a ∼10 cm decay scale. Debris flux across the glacier surface scales with the product of debris thickness and local slope. Analytical and numerical results show that medial moraines should develop cross-glacier profiles with parabolic crests and linear slopes, and should widen with age and hence distance down-glacier. Debris should be both thin and uniform over the moraine. Observed faster-than-linear growth of moraine widths with distance reflects the increasing ablation rate down-glacier. Increase in medial moraine cover reduces the local average ablation rate, allowing the glacier to extend further down-valley than meteorology alone would suggest. This feedback is especially effective when moraines merge.},

	abstract = {There exists within glaciology a widely held assumption that basal sliding and bed deformation do not operate beneath cold-based ice and that their basal velocity is therefore zero, irrespective of bed conditions. Consequently, their ability to erode, entrain and transport sediment and thereby alter the landscape is assumed to be limited. Consequently, very little research has been focused towards describing and understanding the motion of cold-based ice-masses and our knowledge of their behaviour remains poor and the assumption of zero basal velocity, unchallenged. In this review paper, it is argued that this assumption is not universally applicable and that in certain circumstances, basal processes not only remain active at sub-freezing temperatures, but can significantly influence glacier motion. This is particularly the case in glaciers where sub-freezing basal thermal conditions coincide with the presence of fine grained, ice-rich subglacial sediments. Due to the lack of work undertaken on contemporary cold-based glaciers, much of the information used to support this argument is derived from field research in permafrost areas and on Quaternary glacial sediments, and from the laboratory testing of ice/sediment mixtures. It is concluded that the assumption of zero basal velocity beneath cold-based ice is overly simplistic and that in reality, the situation is likely to be much more complex. Work is therefore urgently required: firstly, to investigate the circumstances in which basal motion remains active at sub-freezing temperatures and to determine their influence on glacier motion and; secondly, to examine the likely extent of subglacial permafrost in both the contemporary and Quaternary glacial environment.},

These measurements show that debris entrainment has occurred without alteration of the glacial ice, and provide the most direct evidence to date that active entrainment occurs at the beds of cold glaciers, without bulk freezing of water. Entrainment at subfreezing temperatures may have formed the U-shaped trough containing Meserve Glacier. In addition to possibly allowing some cold-based glaciers to be important geomorphic agents, entrainment at subfreezing temperatures provides a general mechanism for formation of the dirty basal layers of polar glaciers and ice sheets, which are rheologically distinct and can limit the time span of ice-core analyses. Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that geomorphologists should abandon the assumption that cold-based glaciers do not slide and abrade their beds.},

	abstract = {Cold-based glaciers have long been recognized as capable of covering and protecting landscapes. However, recent studies of modern cold-based glaciers in Antarctica show that, in some situations, erosion, deformation and deposition can occur. Recognizing the dual ability of cold-based glaciers to protect and preserve surfaces on the one hand and erode and modify on the other is important for correctly interpreting the often-subtle imprint of cold-based glaciers on landscapes. A range of geomorphological features related to cold-based glacier activity has now been documented along with an improved understanding of cold-based glacier structure, processes and interaction with various substrates. Collectively, this provides an enhanced ability to understand the impact of cold-based glaciers on landscapes and reappraise the geomorphological record. Such insight allows recognition of previously unknown glacial events and better interpretations of the landscape exposure record. This is particularly important at the margins of the Antarctic Ice Sheets, where past fluctuations in ice sheet volume and its contributions to post glacial sea-level rise are poorly constrained. This paper reviews the known geomorphological evidence associated with cold-based glaciers in the South Victoria Land region of the Transantarctic Mountains. It aims to provide progress towards a set of criteria for recognizing cold-based glacier activity in other regions and to highlight the implications of cold-based glacial activity for surface exposure studies and interpreting glacial history.},

We extend this classification to cover the continental interior of Antarctica by analysing the hypsometry of the subglacial landscape using a recently released dataset of bed topography (BEDMAP2). We used the existing classification as a basis for first developing a low-resolution description of landscape evolution under the ice sheet before building a more detailed classification of patterns of glacial erosion. Our key finding is that a more widespread distribution of ancient, preserved alpine landscapes may survive beneath the Antarctic ice sheets than has been previously recognized. Furthermore, the findings suggest that landscapes of selective erosion exist further inland than might be expected, and may reflect the presence of thinner, less extensive ice in the past. Much of the selective nature of erosion may be controlled by pre-glacial topography, and especially by the large-scale tectonic structure and fluvial valley network. The hypotheses of landscape evolution presented here can be tested by future surveys of the Antarctic ice sheet bed.},

Glacial landscapes are classified according to the three criteria of internal age gradients, presence or absence of meltwater traces aligned to flow traces, and basal condition (frozen bed/thawed bed) inferred from morphology. The inversion model uses landscapes classified accordingly, spatially delineated into fans, as input data. Relative chronologies at fan intersections are used to sort fans in a relative-age stack that can be linked to stratigraphic (dating) information.},

The interpretation of these records relies on the assumption that the trace constituents used as proxies for past climate have undergone only modest post-depositional migration. Many of the constituents are soluble impurities found principally in unfrozen liquid that separates the grain boundaries in ice sheets. This phase behaviour, termed premelting, is characteristic of polycrystalline material4,5. Here we show that premelting influences compositional diffusion in a manner that causes the advection of impurity anomalies towards warmer regions while maintaining their spatial integrity. Notwithstanding chemical reactions that might fix certain species against this prevailing transport, we find that—under conditions that resemble those encountered in the Eemian interglacial ice of central Greenland (from about 125,000 to 115,000 years ago)—impurity fluctuations may be separated from ice of the same age by as much as 50 cm. This distance is comparable to the ice thickness of the contested sudden cooling events in Eemian ice from the GRIP core.},

	abstract = {Surface-energy considerations (Smith, 1948), together with the recent measurements of dihedral angle by KLetcham and Hobbs (1969), lead to the conclusion that in pure polycrystalline ice in equilibrium at the melting point the water phase is situated in channels at three-grain intersections. The channels join together in fours at the four-grain intersections in tetrahedra having concave non-spherical faces. Observations by Professor R. L. Shreve and the authors support this conclusion, which is contrary to the view of Steinemann (1958[a], îb]), and which implies that ice at the melting point is permeable t o water. Subject to a reservation about the possible influence of impurities, one may conclude that a temperate glacier is filled with a three-dimensional network of veins of water between the grains. The water flows downwards, replenished by melt water from the surface and by melt produced by heat of deformation within the glacier, at a rate that depends on the fractional volume occupied by the water. This can adjust itself to carry the flow supplied; kinematic waves with sharp shock fronts wilt therefore be possible. The most important function of the vein system may be that it provides an efficient means of flushing impurities into and out of the glacier.},

Systematic study reveals the range of critical phenomena, equilibrium and nonequilibrium phase-transitions, and, most relevant to this review, premelting, that are traditionally studied in more simply bound solids. While this makes investigation of ice as a material appealing from the perspective of the physicist, its ubiquity and importance in the natural environment also make ice compelling to a broad range of disciplines in the Earth and planetary sciences. In this review we describe the physics of the premelting of ice and its relationship with the behavior of other materials more familiar to the condensed-matter community.

	abstract = {Water is present in glaciers in the form of veins at the three-grain junctions. This water remains unfrozen even many degrees below the normal freezing point, mainly because it contains much of the soluble impurity content of a glacier, but also because of the microscopic curvature of the ice–water interfaces. As the temperature is lowered and the veins shrink, the concentration of impurities in them increases, and the curvature effect also increases. The predicted relation between vein size and temperature has now been verified by laboratory experiments.Because of the latent heat of the vein water, the ice behaves macroscopically as a continuum with an anomalous specific heat capacity that depends strongly on temperature. From this point of view, a polythermal glacier is a single medium with continuously varying properties, rather than consisting of distinct cold and temperate phases with sharp boundaries between them. The paper sets up differential equations for heat diffusion in such a continuum. To explain the local uniformity of the vein system seen under the microscope, it is found necessary to include the effect of diffusion of solutes along the veins.Solutions are presented for a model in which two semi-infinite slabs, initially having different temperatures, impurity concentrations and vein sizes, are instantaneously brought into contact. In this way, transition thicknesses between cold and temperate ice are estimated, and also the velocities of various kinds of waves that are generated from the original discontinuity at the interface.},

	abstract = {Glaciers are permeated by liquid veins that line the triple junctions between ice grains and act as conduits for material transport. The density difference between water and ice produces a hydraulic gradient that drives liquid flow down towards the glacier bed. We investigate how variations in this transport rate are manifest in the lower regions of a glacier that floats on a subglacial reservoir. When the temperature rises towards the glacier bed, the associated permeability increase leads to more rapid fluid transport; internal melting supplies the changing flow. A reduction in hydraulic gradient results from surface energy effects, and causes a decreasing transport rate near the base; hence, freezing occurs within the polycrystalline ice. For representative values of the heat flux, soluble impurity loading and grain-size, the downward flux peaks at approximately 1–100mma–1 several tens of centimeters above the glacier bed. Beneath this level, the effects of surface energy control the fluid transport and cause the flow to reverse directions, pulling liquid upwards into the polycrystalline ice so that the flow does not introduce glacial material into the underlying reservoir.},

However, it has inherent limitations, requiring isotropic solid stresses and conditions near bulk equilibrium. Here, we examine when the Clapeyron equation is applicable by providing a rigorous derivation that details all assumptions. We demonstrate the natural extension for anisotropic stress states, and we show how the temperature and pressure ranges for validity depend on well-defined material properties. Finally, we demonstrate how the range of applicability of the (linear) Clapeyron equation can be extended by adding higher-order terms, yielding results that are in good agreement with experimental data for the pressure melting of ice.},

	abstract = {Results of ice-stream models that treat temperate ice deformation as a two-phase flow are sensitive to the ice permeability. We have constructed and begun using a custom, falling-head permeameter for measuring the permeability of temperate, polycrystalline ice. Chilled water is passed through an ice disk that is kept at the pressure-melting temperature while the rate of head decrease indicates the permeability. Fluorescein dye in the water allows water-vein geometry to be studied using fluorescence microscopy. Water flow over durations of seconds to hours is Darcian, and for grain diameter d increasing from 1.7 to 8.9 mm, average permeability decreases from 2 × 10−12 to 4 × 10−15 m2. In tests with dye on fine (d = 2 mm) and coarse (d = 7 mm) ice, average area-weighted vein radii are nearly equal, 41 and 34 μm, respectively. These average radii, if included in a theory slightly modified from Nye and Frank (1973), yield permeability values within a factor of 2.0 of best-fit values based on regression of the data. Permeability values depend on d−3.4, rather than d−2 as predicted by models if vein radii are considered independent of d. In future experiments, the dependence of permeability on liquid water content will be measured.},

Laboratory studies suggest that this process leaves interstitial ice with a distribution of δ18O and δD that is distinct from that developed due to downward freezing of a semi-closed water reservoir. Although as a result of both processes these isotopes lie on a freezing slope in a δD-δ18O diagram, debris layers entrained by regelation past grains are both enriched in heavy isotopes with depth and display a downward decrease in deuterium excess, the converse of that due to downward freezing of a water reservoir. Moreover, the extent of enrichment can be significantly larger in the case of regelation into the bed. Reevaluated field data from West Greenland are consistent with regelation into the bed as an entrainment mechanism.},

We discuss calibration, operational and data-processing procedures, and present an analysis of the measurement errors. The system is modular to facilitate calibration procedures and field repairs. By interchanging logging cables and temperature sensors, measurements can be made in either shallow air-filled boreholes or liquid-filled holes up to 7 km deep. Data can be acquired in either incremental or continuous-logging modes. The precision of data collected by the new logging system is high enough to detect and quantify various thermal effects at the milli-Kelvin level. To illustrate this capability, we present sample data from the 3 km deep borehole at GISP2, Greenland, and from a 130 m deep air-filled hole at Taylor Dome, Antarctica. The precision of the processed GISP2 continuous temperature logs is 0.25–0.34 mK, while the accuracy is estimated to be 4.5 mK. The effects of fluid convection and the dissipation of the thermal disturbance caused by drilling the borehole are clearly visible in the data. The precision of the incremental Taylor Dome measurements varies from 0.11 to 0.32 mK. depending on the wind strength during the experiments. With this precision, we found that temperature fluctuations and multi-hour trends in the BT measurements correlate well with atmospheric-pressure changes.},

	abstract = {We have reconstructed chronology for the disturbed bottom parts of the GRIP and GISP2 ice cores using the combined paleoatmospheric records of CH4 concentration and δ18Oatm in the trapped gases. Our reconstructed ages for basal ice samples are based on comparison of published measurements of CH4 and δ18Oatm from the disturbed section of the GRIP and GISP2 cores with the same properties in the Vostok ice core. NGRIP δ18Oice values are also used to constrain the chronology during the end of marine isotope stage 5e. For each sample, we assign an age that represents the unique or most probable time of gas trapping, given its gas composition. Of 157 samples with CH4 and δ18Oatm data, 10 give unique ages. Twenty-five newly measured values of the triple isotope composition of O2 from the disturbed section of the GISP2 core add a third time-dependent gas property that agrees with our reconstruction. Our reconstruction supports earlier conclusions of Landais et al. (2003) that the disturbed section primarily includes ice from the last interglacial (MIS 5e) and the penultimate glacial period (MIS 6). The oldest ice in the basal layer of GISP2 and GRIP has an age ≥237 ka. The climate history we derive suggests that the last interglacial at Summit, Greenland, around 127 ka was slightly warmer than the current interglacial period. Reduction of various ion concentrations in ice and thickening of the ice sheet during Termination II was similar to that in Termination I.},

	abstract = {Viscous flow in ice is often described by the Glen flow law – a non-Newtonian, power-law relationship between stress and strain rate with a stress exponent n ∼ 3. The Glen law is attributed to grain-size-insensitive dislocation creep; however, laboratory and field studies demonstrate that deformation in ice can be strongly dependent on grain size. This has led to the hypothesis that at sufficiently low stresses, ice flow is controlled by grain boundary sliding, which explicitly incorporates the grain size dependence of ice rheology. Experimental studies find that neither dislocation creep (n ∼ 4) nor grain boundary sliding (n ∼ 1.8) have stress exponents that match the value of n ∼ 3 in the Glen law. Thus, although the Glen law provides an approximate description of ice flow in glaciers and ice sheets, its functional form is not explained by a single deformation mechanism. Here we seek to understand the origin of the n ∼ 3 dependence of the Glen law by using the “wattmeter” to model grain size evolution in ice. The wattmeter posits that grain size is controlled by a balance between the mechanical work required for grain growth and dynamic grain size reduction. Using the wattmeter, we calculate grain size evolution in two end-member cases: (1) a 1-D shear zone and (2) as a function of depth within an ice sheet. Calculated grain sizes match both laboratory data and ice core observations for the interior of ice sheets. Finally, we show that variations in grain size with deformation conditions result in an effective stress exponent intermediate between grain boundary sliding and dislocation creep, which is consistent with a value of n = 3 ± 0.5 over the range of strain rates found in most natural systems.},

In this study, the descending process of sphere in a liquid was examined using coupled LBM–DEM technique. The effects of slope angle, viscosity and friction coefficient on the movement of a sphere were investigated. Two distinct descending patterns were observed: (a) a stable rolling/sliding movement along the slope, and (b) a fluctuating pattern along the slope. Five dimensionless coefficients (Reynolds number (Re), drag coefficient, lift coefficient, moment coefficient and rolling coefficient) were used to analyze the observed processes. The vortex structure in the wake of the sphere gives a lift force to the sphere, which in turn controls the different descending patterns. It is found that the generation of a vortex is not only governed by Re, but also by particle rotation. Relationships between the forces/moments and the dimensionless coefficients are established.},

However, complex and even controversial relationships between hydrodynamic forces and flow conditions hinder the development of an explicit formula for inertial lift acting on finite-sized particles at Reynolds numbers in the hundreds. Herein, we reveal the different scaling laws for shear gradient-induced inertial lift and wall-induced inertial lift by separating the contributions of pressure stress and viscous stress. A direct result of this treatment is a new explicit formula for the total inertial lift, valid for Reynolds numbers up to 400 and particle blockage ratios up to 0.25. This study provides an alternative way to understand inertial lift, thereby greatly facilitating the prediction of particle migration in practical microfluidic applications.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulation of the form and characteristics of Earth's surface provides insight into its evolution. Landlab is an open-source Python package that contains modularized elements of numerical models for Earth's surface, thus reducing time required for researchers to create new or reimplement existing models. Landlab contains a gridding engine which represents the model domain as a dual graph of structured quadrilaterals (e.g., raster) or irregular Voronoi polygon–Delaunay triangle mesh (e.g., regular hexagons, radially symmetric meshes, and fully irregular meshes). Landlab also contains components – modular implementations of single physical processes – and a suite of utilities that support numerical methods, input/output, and visualization. This contribution describes package development since version 1.0 and backward-compatibility-breaking changes that necessitate the new major release, version 2.0. Substantial changes include refactoring the grid, improving the component standard interface, dropping Python 2 support, and creating 31 new components – for a total of 58 components in the Landlab package. We describe reasons why many changes were made in order to provide insight for designers of future packages. We conclude by discussing lessons about the dynamics of scientific software development gained from the experience of using, developing, maintaining, and teaching with Landlab.},
